Hi everyone!! Looking forward to meeting you all.
aI grew up in a small Massachusetts town and later went to UMass Lowell for Computer Science before dropping out to join a startup that didn't end up working out. So it goes...
After a few years of bouncing around Boston tech companies, I moved to New York City for a Software Engineering job @ Meta where I helped build the open-source rich text framework Lexical.
My fingers were crossed that I'd be part of one Meta's mass lay-offs so I could use the severance to turn my side project into a real career, and in May 2023 my wish was granted.
Next summer I'm marrying my girlfriend of 10 years in Southern Maine :)
What I'm working on
Perfectly Imperfect (2020 - present)
A culture newsletter offering “A Taste of Someone’s Taste” via recommendations from guests like Ayo Edebiri, Charli XCX, John Cale, Matty Matheson, Michael Imperioli, Molly Ringwald, and Jack Antonoff. Full archive here.
In January 2024 we launched a social recommendation app called PI.FYI.
Covered by The New York Times (2x), The Verge, NPR Morning Edition, Vanity Fair, Wired, Office Magazine, and more.
We throw parties/concerts around New York City and at SXSW.
Interests
Music- I'm obsessed with music, haha. I write about it often for my newsletter and frequently update a playlist of the best new music in New York City.
Photography- I shoot a lot of slice of life style photos with my Contax t2 and Leica m6.
Film- I'm pretty active on Letterboxd. My current favorites are Buffalo 66, Last Days of Disco, Spiderman 2, and The Long Goodbye
Cycling- A newer passion of mine. Hoping to ride to Montreal from NYC later this year.
DJing- I occasionally DJ parties around NYC. It's fun!
What I can help with
Newsletter growth
Engineering (especially Javascript, React, Node, GraphQL, Apollo, Postgres)
Community building
Publicity & media relations
Culture & trends
Here's a photo of me DJing a party I threw during new york fashion week. (edited)

Hey friends, I'm very excited to join SPC and I cannot wait to work with awesome people like yourselves.
I’m currently building general purpose humanoid robot with my awesome teammates (OGs of humanoid and top AI expert). We’re convicted to deliver a product to customer and scale its skillsets through software updates, like an iPhone, except that now with AI, the software is programmed with language based instructions and human demonstrations.
Our robot can handle stairs, gaps and confined spaces with human level agility, carrying 50lbs human level payload. Our robot will go to every factory, every warehouse and everyone’s home.
About me:
Originally from China, graduated from Umich Ann Arbor Aerospace engineering. I spent 7 years at Apple building decision making technology for Apple’s autonomous systems. Then I cofounded a robotic startup working on automation of cloth manufacturing, where I was in charge of the software and control algorithms for robot arms.
Personal Interests:
Hiphop dance

Hey all, I can't wait to join this amazing community in person next week!
What I'm working on:
I am working with my brother Jon to accelerate development of genetically modified plants (GMOs). We are building a foundation model that can design optimal DNA sequences for any plant species, short-cutting years of breeding and optimization. We hope this can have a transformative impact for food tech, biofuels and carbon capture.
About me:
I grew up in the suburbs of Maryland where I was introduced to bioengineering in high school
In undergrad, I decided to pivot away from computer science and master genetic engineering
I love hiking, squash, scifi, movie nights, and history of science
Previous work and experience:
My PhD research focused on decoding the "programming language" of the human genome
At MIT, my team developed novel programmable circuits for RNA therapeutics and filed a patent
I was lead scientist to set up a lab, build the company and develop our technology
I worked at another biotech company using machine learning for RNA sequence design

Hello folks!  I'm George, and I'm very excited to join SPC NYC and looking forward to meeting people here in person.
Currently I'm in exploration mode and investigating stuff in both crypto and AI.  A few projects I've been mulling on include (1) decentralized marketplace for GPU compute for AI tasks and crypto mining, (2) crypto infrastructure, and (3) protocols for stable coins and decentralized exchange design.  I'm in a broader exploration phase in life though and am trying to actively not commit to one idea or direction for a while.  :sweat_smile:.  I"m also currently doing a comp sci masters, with a focus on AI for fun
Previously I was the COO of dYdX (one of the largest decentralized exchanges in crypto), founder of a social ecommerce company (Moonship), and a product lead at Facebook (where I built up the adtech team and spun up new adtech products in new verticals).  I also founded a company in healthcare tech doing readmissions, and have actively invested in and advised companies in crypto, fintech, saas, ecomm, healthcare, and adtech
Personal interest include working out/trying to get in shape, reading 3-4 books/week, dancing, karaoking, and cooking.  Attached is a photo from back at Facebook where we combined karaoking with a company offsite.  Definitely my favorite offsite
Happy to help out folks with anything related to crypto, healthcare, adtech, saas, ecomm or for folks who want perspectives on contrasting company building at the earliest stage vs series c/d vs big tech
I plan on also spending a fair amount of time in SF, so I hope to meet folks on both coasts :slightly_smiling_face:

Happy Thursday everyone! Pedro here. Stoked to be a part of SPC and thanks 
@Sunita Mohanty
 for the in :raised_hands:
About me:
Born in Havana Cuba :flag-cu: grew up in Spain :es:
Moved to the US for Computer Science grad school at Illinois Tech. Soon after that I moved to foggy, wonderful San Francisco where I lived for 6 years :foggy: They say all Cubans end up in Miami so here I am now!
Been at both bigcos and startups in my career. In past lives I've been in the automotive/hardware side, but transitioned to healthtech in 2018 when I joined Stride Health. I started as an early employee and grew with the company to become its Head of Engineering 1.5 years ago. I built consumer shopping and enrollment,  the mobile apps with tax and banking capabilities, and our Enterprise SaaS Platform (think Shopify but you shop for health plans). Right now we’re at Series C stage and growing fast :rocket:
Recently married, and we just got the cutest puppy human eyes have ever seen.
What I’m currently exploring:
Been tinkering with AI/LLMs since GPT-3 times, but it’s become an obsession lately :slightly_smiling_face:
I’ve wanted to build a company from scratch for a while. And now I’m doing just that! Left Stride a month ago and I'm exploring all angles around a simple premise: there's great healthcare in this country – it's just not evenly distributed. How can we bring it to the masses?
Would love to connect with potential partners, customers, investors, and accelerate my learning. Even though I’ve been at it for more than half a decade, healthcare is a beast and every bit helps!
Talk to me about:
Healthtech! I'm most interested in the business of healthcare: care delivery models, intersection between the clinical and the financial, insurance, aligning the messy incentives, and how technology can transform all those.
Ways I can help others:
Full-stack web and mobile engineering: containerization, serverless, what’s new and easy to use and scale
Interfacing with CMS and the various states for health insurance enrollment (yes… it’s not fun)
Security and Compliance from an Engineering standpoint: NIST, HIPAA, SOC2, audits
Building a high-velocity, healthy, marathon-not-sprint Product and Engineering culture
LLMs, multi-modal models, AI agents, RAG, vectorstores, MLOps.
In general, creating product v1's that aren’t perfect and polishing them into v2s+ is where I feel at home. AMA!
Personal interests:
I am the founder of Casa de la Rumba, a Burning Man camp.
I DJ in my (very little these days) spare time!
Love to travel near and far – last big one was Japan, highly recommend Niseko if you ski
Food in all shapes and sizes (I miss SF’s Burmese food here in Miami, looking for recs!)
Sports: padel, various bootcamps, weightlifting, I do one triathlon a year. Big Real Madrid, F1, and Fernando Alonso fan!
I’m most active on Twitter – let’s connect!

Hi everyone! I'm Ryan, and just joined #spc-nyc this week. Great to meet folks today and looking forward to meeting the rest of you throughout the program.
About me:
I grew up outside of Philadelphia, spent a few years in DC, and now have been in NYC for over a decade. Does that qualify me as an official New Yorker yet? I guess it depends on who you ask.
I've worked in tech for the last 15+ years, mostly as a product manager (and briefly as a developer)
In 2012, I co-founded a startup called Pickie about 10 years ago, which was a mobile commerce platform that went through Techstars NY and was acquired by Retail-Me-Not in 2014.
I've also worked at other tech companies of all sizes, ranging the tech giants (Google, where I was the Product Lead for Google Sheets, among other things), smaller tech startups (Celonis, a late stage enterprise unicorn), to a 30 person startup I joined right out of college, and where I met 
@Wilfred Yeung
 (we joined SPC together)
What I’m currently exploring:
Wilfred covered a few of the areas we’re exploring together (see his intro for more info on the Proptech, Blue collar work, and Elder care areas we’re thinking about). Additional areas of interest:
Better Business Intelligence: We believe there’s an opportunity to make a simpler set of BI tools (potentially leveraging LLMs) to democratize BI and open it up to a broader set of SMBs
Childcare: How can we use tech to make childcare more affordable, safer, more transparent (in terms of what happens when the parents aren’t around), and richer / more educational for the children.
Personal interests:
Board games, poker and bar trivia. I like all kinds of games
Running: Ran my first marathon last year…trying to not be so slow for the next one.
Quantified self: I track all sorts of stuff, and am always looking for more data to collect and act upon)
Standup and improv comedy in NYC
Vegetarian food and restaurant recommendations
Guatemala recommendations: I’m getting married there in less than 2 weeks!
Talk to me about:
Any of the previously mentioned ideas we’re exploring (proptech, blue collar work, eldercare, BI and analytics tools, and childcare opportunities)
Spreadsheets (I may have some Google Sheets tips for you)
Any mutually shared interests
Anything at all, really
Apparently, everyone is going to Brazil these days. I was there for New Years, and here is me and my fiancée at a sunrise hike that we took two weeks ago (

:wave: Hi fellow travelers, I’m Ethan, joining #spc-san-francisco this month to participate in this vibrant community and embark on doing my life’s work alongside you all!
I love writing software, building creative tools, and creating a feeling of magic in this world. My interests lie in sustainability (especially around food, agriculture, and housing), computer graphics, computational fabrication, and [A|V|X]R/“spatial computing.”
Who dis:
Grew up in North Carolina, spent 8 years in the Boston area for undergrad at MIT and working as a software engineer (at Formlabs and then Clover Food Lab). For a while, was convinced I’d only work at places with Lab in their name. :sweat_smile:
Spent the past 5 years living in Singapore :flag-sg: working at Stripe on APAC expansion efforts, and then a startup I cofounded during COVID called Betafi, making software for UX research.
Transitioned our business to a bootstrapping model after a painful (but enlightening) year of dashed fundraising efforts, now exploring new directions and considering starting a new company in the domain of spatial computing.
Definitely experiencing a bit of reverse culture shock being back in the US now, just landed a few days ago. Feel like we have a lot to learn from our friends in APAC about how to approach urban planning and hope I can contribute to efforts to transplant some of these ideas to the US, or at least empower people who are striving for this (either just in my limited capacity as a voter, or maybe as part of my next -1-0 adventure!)
What I’m hoping to achieve in the next 3-6 months at SPC:
Will be building a series of progressively more ambitious prototypes & applications targeting the Apple Vision Pro (& more cross-platform experiences via WebXR). The first app I’ve built is a multiplayer Mahjong game: if anyone’s a Mahjong fan, would be a blast to play IRL some upcoming poker night. :mahjong:️
Will be exploring opportunities at the intersection of purpose (urban planning, affordable housing, sustainable ag/transport) + technical interests to try and build a venture-scale business that I could happily devote the next 10+ years of my life to.
Excited to find collaborators and otherwise just geek out if we share some overlapping interests, or if you’re keen to play around and give feedback on early prototypes and inklings of ideas for new spatial experiences and interactions I’ll be tinkering with!
Hobbies:
I love rock climbing, cycling, hiking, traveling & gawking at exquisite architecture, beekeeping, gardening, eating delicious food and drinking delicious coffee with friends.
Will be onboarding properly later this month, but will try and visit the space regularly over the next couple of weeks & looking forward to meeting you all! (edited)

Hi everyone! I'm Jason James. Myself and my co-founder (
@RVP
) run a stealth gen AI startup building our MVP. We're not in the #spc-san-francisco program per se, but excited to participate with the SPC community as a portfolio company.
About me:
Grew up in rural northern Illinois. Made my way to Chicago in my twenties. Then, the Bay Area for ~7 years. Mid-COVID I moved back home "temporarily" with my wife and liked being around friends & family, so I've been 75% IL, 25% CA for the last 3 years.
10 years in agency-life doing traditional marketing, advertising, and brand design
12 years in tech doing a mixture of leading design orgs (product design, brand, research, and content) and PM orgs
Mostly done early stage roles. Employee #3 at Kin HR, #12 at Earnest, #40 at Intercom. And some later stage roles too at Thumbtack and Instacart.
Most recently wrapped up leading the consumer business at Instacart as the VP of Product/Head of Instacart App
Took some time off, then started Tezi (stealth startup) with RVP in December. We raised a Seed round, have hired some founding engineers, and are building the MVP.
What I’m currently exploring:
AI agent-based workflows
How companies hire
Lean people-lite ways of doing G&A
Personal interests:
Working through a bunch of interior design & decorating opportunities, as my wife and I just built a house and moved in
Optimizing myself (strength training, meditation, sleep health, stretching, journaling, etc.)
Reading (business case studies, memoirs, fiction, and social science non-fiction)
Talk to me about:
Culture-building
Product design & development
GTM & pricing
Marketplaces
Hiring / recruiting
I'll try to make some SPC events when I'm in the Bay each month. Excited to be here with you all!

Hi all! I’m Jimmy and I’m joining #spc-nyc next week. Excited to be here!
About me:
Born and raised in Chicago but have been on the east coast since college
Spent the last ~7 years as cofounder and CTO of a K-12 EdTech startup called PathwayOS, which was acquired by Vector Solutions last October
Prior to that, I ran a digital consulting agency and also wrote some iOS + entrepreneurship curriculum for high schools
I’ve also spent some time working with Apple on their Server Side Work Group, helping foster and drive the direction of Swift on the Server (lots to share here if you’re interested!)
Currently exploring:
I’m super interested in understanding what industry-specific legacy tech exists that could be made easier with an API. I’m approaching this from a few different angles:
Legacy protocols: What are the technical costs that companies have to pay when entering or moving up-market in legacy or regulated industries? I saw a lot of this in EdTech and in the last few months explored the SFTP space a bit. EDI/AS2 is also interesting to me here. (Stedi is a great example)
API-fying the real world: I think APIs that cause something to happen IRL are really cool (see: Lob) - lots of industries still have paper workflows at their core!
Unstructured data: So much enterprise data is in PDFs, powerpoints, etc, and we have all this great new vector/embeddings tech. How can we make that data available in workflows?
Somewhat separately, I’m interested in tooling that companies have to build to support in-product custom reporting and custom exports
Some stuff I’ve built recently:
I’ve been tinkering a lot in my time off, here are some fun things I’ve built the past 3 months:
I hacked my apartment complex intercom buzzer to make it a little smarter (blog post)
A small app that quizzes me on poker ranks and combinations so that I stand a chance in my friend group poker game
An RSVP system for my wedding using Remix (none of the existing platforms quite worked how I needed)
Personal interests:
Dogs (or my dog in particular :laughing:)
Reading
Hanging out in Central Park
Talk to me about:
Anything technical, but particularly legacy protocols/integrations
The US education system (edtech, policy, public/private/charter, all of it :upside_down_face:)
High school speech and debate (super dorky, I know!)
Here’s a fun picture of my dog, Oslo, trying to figure out who that other dog in the mirror is :laughing:

Hi everyone! Stoked to be here and join #spc-san-francisco this week!
About me:
“Applied ML researcher”  turned “Big AI Guy” now that we have to call it by a new name
Spent my career so far integrating machine intelligence into our physical world
Previously research scientist at Fitbit, MLE/EM/SWE at Cruise and Waymo
Spent 25 years in the bitter cold (Chicago/Boston/Michigan) before I realized there was another option
Got sick of starting new ML products inside existing large companies and (somewhat) rage quit my job in November
Currently exploring:
Broadly: using AI to reduce costs for the transition to a low carbon world
Aerial inspection of solar panels to reduce maintenance burden for homeowners and MSB
Fast, few shot analysis of drone footage for surveying and inspection
Remote sensing foundation models
Multimodal models for increasingly niche modalities
Some stuff I’ve built recently:
Moonshine, pre-trained remote sensing models with a friendly UI

Waymo Freeway Driving, if you think accelerating onto the 280 in an EV is fun try it with nobody in the driver’s seat
Personal interests:
I enjoy to both cook and bake. I can crush desserts like you would not believe.
I love music in all forms. I play guitar/bass/drums/keys and am learning to sing, and in previous life produced concerts and music. I’m def not above any genre.
Good views are my weakness. In pursuit of this I paraglide and am currently learning to fly fixed wing aircraft.
Tea! I don’t drink coffee and I wouldn’t say I’m a snob about tea but I would say I’m “passionate”.
Talk to me about:
Anytime you’ve gone “people still do that by hand???”
Any pain points you’ve discovered in clean tech — weird thing you hate about your EV? Annoying thing about owning solar panels? Let me know!
A clever way to create a multimodal tokenizer you’ve brainstormed
See anything in “personal interests”, or a good Pho place in SF you’ve discovered to replace Turtle Tower (rest in peace)

Hi Everybody! Just joined yesterday, and very excited to be here!
A bit about me....
I was most recently running online marketing at Angi (formally Angie's List / Homeadvisor), but I came to Angi by way of an acquisition of Handy Technologies, a start-up based out of New York.  I have a strong background in growing early stage and mid-stage start-ups, as well as experience working within a large, publicly traded company. I have learned first-hand how to grow a business from the ground-up, ands have worn many hats! I have experience in P&L management, business devlopment / partnerships, product, performance marketing, and anything and everything growth-related. I know the start-up grind well - I have lived it several times over - and have seen both the successes as well as huge failures that come with the grind. I love it, and can't wait to chat with all of you! Here is my Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristiana-laugen-4b116047/
Personal interests
I am a fitness junkie (love group classes! Will try any ClassPass studio once), am obsessed with my dog (his name is Pashko! He looks like a wolf but is a big old softie), and I like to experiment in the kitchen.
What you're currently exploring
Right now, I am exploring buying and then growing a small business - called "Entrepreneurship through acquisition" (ETA) by those in the know :wink:. I also recently started serving on the board of a non-profit called Fortitude... and am doing a lot of ad-hoc advising and some idea exploration for starting my own business.
Topics members can ask you about
Home services, marketplace businesses, anything P&L management related, business development, partnerships, etc.

I used code neutral networks from scratch in the Stone Age of ML (mid 2000s). So, I am so grateful for the ML tools and libraries we have now.
I once lived on only rice, and beans for several months to save money, while backpacking around the world.
Currently exploring:
Interactive ML playgrounds for weaving genAI models and tools together.
Visual media authorship.
The use of diffusion models and vision transformers in ML for generative AI
Some stuff I’ve built recently:
I've built a lot of data pipelines for AI, server/client systems for interacting with ML models, systems for fine-tuning ML models

HotTake - An app for creating, distributing, tracing, and safely sharing your images (www.gethottake.com)
Personal interests:
Playing/composing music on guitar/piano/sax
Dancing either salsa, bachata, or swing. I also danced on a ballroom dance team in uni. And choreographed wedding dances in a previous life.
Traveling. I've lived in 5 countries and have traveled to 50+. I'll be in Singapore in May to present my latest research at an MRI conference. (Any advice for visiting Singapore?)
Learning languages. I think languages are a great way to learn about another culture and way of life. I'm fluent in three and have dabbled in 5 others.
Financial economics, and history (love reading biographies of interesting people in history)

Hi SPC Community,
I'm building Borderless :globe_with_meridians:, the global citizenship platform that empowers individuals to acquire, manage, and maximize the benefits of multiple passports. We're currently exploring solutions to solve citizenship-by-descent for the growing population of first, second, and third generation Americans.
Today we can screen you for citizenship eligibility to any country in the world, and share back the results (with guidance) in a concise manner.
About me:
I’m a British/American global citizen based in San Francisco :gb:/:us:
I’ve been building community for entrepreneurship focused ecosystems for 8+ years
Previously I served as founding creative director with SHACK15 in San Francisco
Interestingly:
Every year my friends and I light a laser rainbow over San Francisco for Pride weekend :rainbow::sparkles:
In another life I taught Rihanna how to snowboard in Aspen (she’s lovely)
A lifetime ambition of mine is to create the first Earth passport
If any of this sounds interesting to you, or if you're curious about your own relationship global citizenship – let’s chat – I’m a fast learner, I’m here to build, and I’ll need as much help as I can get.
Looking forward to meeting you! :pray::skin-tone-3: (edited)

Hi! Really excited to be joining in SF, looking forward to getting to know you all.
About me
I’m from the UK, currently splitting time between SF and London but moving this year.
I spent the last 4 years in research at DeepMind working on all sorts of general intelligence things: LLMs, embodied agents, evaluation & interpretability (I think this paper on what AlphaZero knows is the best thing I did at DM).
I’ve been on sabbatical since September and went climbing in the Himalayas and learnt to ski in Canada.
Interests
Outdoor sports: skiing, climbing, hiking, getting back into trail running.
Physics: I’m intermittently trying to self-study up to QFT and GR.
What I’m exploring
My main focus for exploration right now is applied interpretability.
I have a big list of ideas - would love to chat about anything on here.
Ask me about
AI, especially transformers and interpretability.
General guesses about AI over the next few years.
Success/failure modes for research organisations.
I’d love to learn about
Robotics! I'd be interested in joining/starting a study group on this.
How to think about all the non-technical parts of building a startup.

Hi everyone! Excited to join SPC. 
@Mark Jacobstein
 (#spc-san-francisco), Sahil, and I (#spc-nyc) started Jimini Health recently, where we have created the best therapy experience ever,
with the most experienced clinicians out there
with a holistic approach to it (where patients can choose broader health and mindfulness techniques for their clinician to work with them on)
very goals driven, with clear objectives for change (never again talking in circle for weeks)
and allowing patients to receive and gain skills every day,
more cost effective than private practice therapists (that can cost 200-300/hour/week)
It's therapy like we and all of our patients always wanted! We have a small number of slots left for our Q2 patient cohort, in case anyone here needs, please be in touch (We are in CA, CO, Fl, PA; not NY yet). If you are interested in trying it out, I’m happy to hop on a call myself to answer any question. Feel free to pick a time here: https://calendar.app.google/r5drmkPzyQ6nBnVv8
My background:
Founded an AI/cancer company called Immunai before (where I worked with Mark) valued at over 1 bliion
Faculty at Stanford (where I teach about AI)
Previously at Palantir, and MIT BSc/MSc/Phd dropout.
and Mark's / Sahil's background is even better!
Excited to meet you all soon. (edited)

Hello SPC – Appreciate the warm welcome so far and excited to meet others soon!
Exploring digital-twins for navigating health services – 
@Shruti Tibrewala
 and I think there is growing awareness in the US that the fee-for-service healthcare system is most useful when problems become acute but everyone is on their own for prevention and risk mgmt. HSAs, price transparency + CURES acts (your med data is now yours vs providers’) and LLMs for unstructured data have brought an inflection point. We dream about a digital twin of health data+models to both be the starting point (from a new need to highest ROI interventions) and the destination (a compounding data vault) of all unsolved patient needs outside of the hospital.
Targeting MSK as the beachhead – the incentives of the sickcare system don't favor this so we need to establish an alternative outside of it. Joint health is one of the largest spend areas, with terrible outcomes in the default care paths (with cookie cutter PT and/or unnecessary surgery) and clearly better but currently expensive approaches only available to top athletes or execs. These are a handful of out-of-network providers that are often booked out by top teams or established patients for many months and we’re looking to digitally scale access to as the starting point.
Most recently, spent a decade at Palantir – joined to build a civilian business, which was consulting-y for a while but productized initial successes around data+model integration into a platform for building digital-twins to assist operational decision-making in less tech-savvy domains like energy, industrials and supply chains. With COVID's shakeup and the ZIRP boost we were able to go public and eventually get to GAAP profitable so I'm happy that I stayed through the dark days until mission accomplished, but less so that I’m now 35.
Before that I founded a YC S12 company that became Palantir’s first acquisition, and before that I built a primitive version of pre-Siri voice control at Stanford AI/HCI labs first, then launched it in Android at Google.
I'm originally from Turkey and live near Sutro Forest / Twin Peaks. I talk more about video/board games than I actually get to play but always looking for an opportunity to change that. If you have MSK/health stories or just want to say hi, please do not hesitate!

Hey SPC! Great to meet you all. I’m joining as an affiliate of @Arda Kara.
I’m a healthcare and health data nerd :nerd_face:  and generally excited about helping people make more of their data and evidence :chart_with_upwards_trend:. I’m hoping the time is right now to finally solve for the patient at the center of care.
I’ve spent my career in healthcare and health tech companies of various sizes, leading GTM / commercialization, ranging from a seed stage AI-software company to Flatiron Health, where I learnt a ton about how messy and challenging health data is but the really cool stuff we can learn from it.
I’m born and raised in Mumbai, India but have been a Bay Area native all my adult life and love it here. I live in mission bay, so you may see me walking my Aussie :walking-the-dog: near the SPC office or grabbing coffee at Golden Goat.
Feel free to hit me up if I can help with anything healthcare / life sciences! I’d also welcome any convos on what we’re building, life in SF or India (especially in the context of aging parents) or general banter.

Hi! I'm excited to be a member at SPC SF!!
About Me - LinkedIn
I grew up in a tiny village in the north of Poland :flag-pl:. I ventured out early, when I was 15, attending a high school in another city (fun fact: my boarding school friends from these days led the development of GPT-4 and OpenAI Dota Five) and then moving to the UK to do my undergrad and master's in Computer Science at Imperial College London :gb:
Professionally, I've done engineering, data science, ML and product at startups (CircleUp) and larger companies (Amazon, Stitch Fix, King.com) in SF, Seattle and Stockholm :bridge_at_night: :seattle: :flag-se:
Stuff I built in the last 10 years and topics I can help with:
Was the founding director of the Data Driven Investing department at Bain Capital Ventures leading the effort to bring the latest in ML/DS to their investing efforts. Went from 1 IC running scripts on a laptop to an engineering and data science team with production systems on AWS, Snowflake, DBT, terraform and ML models.
Jumped through months of legal and political hoops to initiate the collaboration between Stitch Fix and OpenAI. We were one of the first teams in the world to collaborate with OpenAI’s team on their alpha API exposing early GPT-3 and DALLE models, fine-tuning etc., months before the public release of ChatGPT. I led workshops on NLP, transformers, built tools to help both data scientists and product managers plug into these capabilities.
Years of experience unlocking text data for ML applications at scale. I led multiple projects to leverage millions of item-level text feedback notes from Stitch Fix clients to improve our recommendation systems and search. Some of my work made it to this blog and TechCrunch. I also created a product classification system to enable evaluating millions of emerging consumer products for investing purposes at CircleUp.
Built from scratch or upgraded numerous engineering and ML systems, e.g. transitioned Stitch Fix's stylist recommendation system from batch to real-time, implemented batch messaging system for Amazon Kindle’s push notifications, built a semi-realtime anomaly detection system for popular games like Candy Crush and Farm Heros Saga.
Interests
Building stuff and entrepreneurship! I run a few cash flow side hustles, mostly with 
@Adam Szefer
, e.g. we’re renovating and renting out a 200 year old property in Poland. Hit us up if you need a unique spot for a wedding or retreat!
Hosting and community building. Every month I host at least a few friends, sometimes for weeks at a time. In September I’m organizing a world reunion for ~100 alumni of CRS camp I went to as a teenager (please considering donating to this nonprofit here)
Escape rooms and board games (I may have done all escape rooms in SF already...) :old_key:
Biking around SF, hiking, backpacking, kayaking, traveling (most recently hiked in Tasmania :koala: and Japan :sushi:)
Currently exploring
Teaming up with my brother

Hi everyone!! Looking forward to meeting you all.
aI grew up in a small Massachusetts town and later went to UMass Lowell for Computer Science before dropping out to join a startup that didn't end up working out. So it goes...
After a few years of bouncing around Boston tech companies, I moved to New York City for a Software Engineering job @ Meta where I helped build the open-source rich text framework Lexical.
My fingers were crossed that I'd be part of one Meta's mass lay-offs so I could use the severance to turn my side project into a real career, and in May 2023 my wish was granted.
Next summer I'm marrying my girlfriend of 10 years in Southern Maine :)
What I'm working on
Perfectly Imperfect (2020 - present)
A culture newsletter offering “A Taste of Someone’s Taste” via recommendations from guests like Ayo Edebiri, Charli XCX, John Cale, Matty Matheson, Michael Imperioli, Molly Ringwald, and Jack Antonoff. Full archive here.
In January 2024 we launched a social recommendation app called PI.FYI.
Covered by The New York Times (2x), The Verge, NPR Morning Edition, Vanity Fair, Wired, Office Magazine, and more.
We throw parties/concerts around New York City and at SXSW.
Interests
Music- I'm obsessed with music, haha. I write about it often for my newsletter and frequently update a playlist of the best new music in New York City.
Photography- I shoot a lot of slice of life style photos with my Contax t2 and Leica m6.

Hey friends, I'm very excited to join SPC and I cannot wait to work with awesome people like yourselves.
I’m currently building general purpose humanoid robot with my awesome teammates (OGs of humanoid and top AI expert). We’re convicted to deliver a product to customer and scale its skillsets through software updates, like an iPhone, except that now with AI, the software is programmed with language based instructions and human demonstrations.
Our robot can handle stairs, gaps and confined spaces with human level agility, carrying 50lbs human level payload. Our robot will go to every factory, every warehouse and everyone’s home.
About me:
Originally from China, graduated from Umich Ann Arbor Aerospace engineering. I spent 7 years at Apple building decision making technology for Apple’s autonomous systems. Then I cofounded a robotic startup working on automation of cloth manufacturing, where I was in charge of the software and control algorithms for robot arms.
Personal Interests:
Hiphop dance
Barbecue

Hey all, I can't wait to join this amazing community in person next week!
What I'm working on:
I am working with my brother Jon to accelerate development of genetically modified plants (GMOs). We are building a foundation model that can design optimal DNA sequences for any plant species, short-cutting years of breeding and optimization. We hope this can have a transformative impact for food tech, biofuels and carbon capture.
About me:
I grew up in the suburbs of Maryland where I was introduced to bioengineering in high school
In undergrad, I decided to pivot away from computer science and master genetic engineering
I love hiking, squash, scifi, movie nights, and history of science
Previous work and experience:
My PhD research focused on decoding the "programming language" of the human genome
At MIT, my team developed novel programmable circuits for RNA therapeutics and filed a patent
I was lead scientist to set up a lab, build the company and develop our technology
I worked at another biotech company using machine learning for RNA sequence design

Hello folks!  I'm George, and I'm very excited to join SPC NYC and looking forward to meeting people here in person.
Currently I'm in exploration mode and investigating stuff in both crypto and AI.  A few projects I've been mulling on include (1) decentralized marketplace for GPU compute for AI tasks and crypto mining, (2) crypto infrastructure, and (3) protocols for stable coins and decentralized exchange design.  I'm in a broader exploration phase in life though and am trying to actively not commit to one idea or direction for a while.  :sweat_smile:.  I"m also currently doing a comp sci masters, with a focus on AI for fun
Previously I was the COO of dYdX (one of the largest decentralized exchanges in crypto), founder of a social ecommerce company (Moonship), and a product lead at Facebook (where I built up the adtech team and spun up new adtech products in new verticals).  I also founded a company in healthcare tech doing readmissions, and have actively invested in and advised companies in crypto, fintech, saas, ecomm, healthcare, and adtech
Personal interest include working out/trying to get in shape, reading 3-4 books/week, dancing, karaoking, and cooking.  Attached is a photo from back at Facebook where we combined karaoking with a company offsite.  Definitely my favorite offsite
Happy to help out folks with anything related to crypto, healthcare, adtech, saas, ecomm or for folks who want perspectives on contrasting company building at the earliest stage vs series c/d vs big tech
I plan on also spending a fair amount of time in SF, so I hope to meet folks on both coasts :slightly_smiling_face:

Hey everyone! Really excited to be joining the SPC community in SF soon. :grin:
My co-founder, Guglielmo, and I are working on building developer tools for simulation and synthetic data generation, initially targeting the robotics space. We’ve spent a lot of time over the years seeing common simulation infrastructure get re-built across orgs and believe that simulation data will be a huge enabler for training large behavior models for robotic systems at scale, so we are aiming to build the platform that accelerates robot learning and beyond.
A little bit about me:
I grew up in North Carolina and was really excited by racing and motorsports during my childhood -- I ended up spending some time building data-driven models for dynamics simulations for a NASCAR team during undergrad.
I later did my M.S. in Robotics at CMU, working on research in the Autonomous Vehicle space.
After grad school, I joined what was then a young startup, Relativity Space, and built out the core control architecture and machine learning infrastructure for their robotics stack, eventually leading small R&D team. Our robots built a rocket that was >90% metal 3D printed by mass :rocket::robot_face:
After a few years there I ended up at NASA JPL, where I met my (now) co-founder and we worked together on the autonomy stack for a robotic snake platform, EELS. We ended up deploying the system on a remote glacier in Canada for a month!
In my free time, I love rock-climbing, snowboarding, hiking with my wife and dog, and trying to read and implement whatever research papers I’ve gotten excited about over the past week :slightly_smiling_face:.
Please reach out if you'd like to chat some time! :smile:

Hi guys! It's great to meet you all,  and I'm excited to get some in-person time together next week.  First time coming out to SF!
A bit about myself:
I'm from the Midwest and am currently based in Kansas City with my wife, Mary.  We have a dog, Sunny, and a cat who we refer to as Kit Cat. Our free time is best spent in the outdoors, as we both enjoy camping, hiking, and just taking it all in. No kids yet, so we're taking advantage of the extra freedom with the occasional trip.
My work:
I've spent the majority of my career in the agriculture, as I worked as an agricultural lender in the Farm Credit System for roughly a decade.  The experience led to my interest in regenerative agriculture and its potential to have a healing impact on our health, environment, and communities.
I left my role as a lender a little over a year ago to build a land management service for landowners and operators eager to adopt regenerative principles. This journey led me to meeting my business partner, Rhys Algar, and founding of Rooted Ag. 
Rooted Ag is a farm management platform, providing customized data-driven plans and resource coordination to landowners.

Hi everyone, excited to join SPC SF and meet you all in person next week!
- I'm fortunate to be working with my partner, 
@Allison Fu
, at the intersection of our interests and our professional experience.
- We're currently exploring what content creation (both video and gaming) will look like when you build end-to-end around AI. This touches a lot on how games of the future will tell stories and immerse their players.
- Originally from the Maryland suburbs of DC, rowing was my main activity in high school. Went to undergrad at MIT where I moved from rowing and sun to algorithms and darkness :new_moon_with_face:
- Avid consumer of everything gaming and fantasy related, particularly real-time strategy games. Cooking has been a big part of my life as well.
- Storytelling has always been particularly important to me: D&D was big for me growing up. It's been exciting to watch the roleplaying content space evolve so much in the last ten years. If anyone is interested but unsure, I'd recommend checking out Dimension 20!
- Before this I was building training and data infrastructure on Nuro's ML infra team.

Hi friends! I’m Irfan :wave::skin-tone-5: Am super excited to fold into this community, learn from y’all and help how I can.
What I'm working on:
@Paul Crouther
 and I are building the world’s first event planning agent (initial focus on weddings).  Americans couples are drowning in complex logistics and generic design ideas over 12+ months of stressful wedding planning. June will help as a design-forward assistant cutting down the effort to collaborate with vendors and planners to get wedding work done.
About me:
Love to cook. It’s mindful and fun! Have been on a brining & spatchcocking kick (recently made was a 36 hour-brined gochugaru chicken:hot_pepper::fried_chicken:).
Am obsessed with how AI agents :robot_face: can democratize access to services previously gate-kept due to supply constraints (i.e. too high a cost to access). <- I think this is an awesome lens to evaluate opportunity for anyone considering agent businesses (come nerd out with me about it!).
Try my best to lead with kindness, including with the products I build.
Previous work and experience:
Led Product Teams at Instagram for ~5 years before - have shipped across Stories, Direct Messaging and Home Feed.
Prior I was in Product at Zillow, launching a marketplace for new construction homes (connecting builders and buyers).
Have built a few of 0-to-1 new vertical businesses/products at larger companies.
MBA (please don’t hold it against me :sweat_smile:)
What I can help with:
Anything social media (from growth hacking to building network effects)
Marketplace dynamics

Hi everyone :wave:
I'm Meher — an intuitive designer, community-builder and leader, leveraging creative and data-driven solutions to bring clarity to the world around us. Excited to be part of SPC community as an affiliate of 
@Amanda DeLuca
.
Fun fact — Amanda and I worked together at Etsy and now years later, we're working together again; this time on designing and building Riley — the first ever completely personalized parents AI companion.
A little bit more about me —
I love building community. As a result, i'm usually hosting friends for board game nights, meditations, dinner parties, or a good 'ol rot session.
I love interior design/sustainability and work with clients across the world for their interior design needs, my own apartment in NYC has been features on apartment therapy, kaiyo, etc — I document all of this on my instagram here.
I've been based in New York for the last 12 years (with a short 1 year stint in Guatemala) and currently am planning to live across NYC and Portugal for the next 8-12 months. Welcoming any advice from anyone else who has done this before.
Career —
I have a background in design + psychology and have been really fortunate to have many incredible opportunities over the last 8 years. Most recently, I led design on the Buyer Ads Experience team at Etsy, launching impact-driven and human-centered features to over 96 million buyers and supporting seller growth and spoke.
In 2022, I challenged to focus more on my personal career goals and went and spoke to 200k people at Config 2022 (Figmas annual conference) about design as a catalyst for organizational rituals, connection and delight. I'll be going back as audience this year, say hi if you're gonna be there! :wave:
Before Etsy, I led design at Healthcare dot com (lead generation and B2C consumer growth), Jackpocket (gaming lottery), and Zola (weddings!).
What I can offer —
I have a very growth-service driven approach towards everything I do, as an extension of that I love mentoring emerging designers especially those in marginalized communities. If you know any designers looking for support, DM me :slightly_smiling_face:
Interior design consults
Design/leadership brainstorming
Hoping to meet some of you when I'm back in New York around the NYC office :party:

Hi everyone! I’ve been SPC member before, but I’ve rejoined SPC 380 Brannan office for the the month of May while I figure out where to go next. I’m choosing between 1) helping a former co-worker spin up a new AI Lab at Figma, 2) going to Together AI to solve asynchronous training. How to choose? (any feedback appreciated).
I’ve been in the field of AI for the last 20 years (my first paper was in 2004), and I’ve helped jump-start Neural Network transition at Google by hiring Ian Goodefellow and building the first NN-based system that outperformed classical vision system used by StreetView at the time. In the early days of NN development, some mistakes were made which persist to this day. In the next 20 years I aim to rectify some of them (summary)
What I can offer
- high-level advice on AI and constructive criticism (if you want to hear all the ways your idea can fail)
What I could use help with
- Advice on the skills needed to succeed at a higher-level management position (I’ve so far mainly been an IC/researcher) (edited)

Hi SPC! It's great to be part of this exceptional community - right now, I'm in SPC SF, but would love to visit NY one of these days.
about me:
Filipino-Chinese immigrant from the Philippines (Manila, specifically).
Middle school, high school, undergrad, grad school all here in the Bay Area (Hayward for the first two, then Stanford for the latter two).
Adopted by a cat named Sparky. He literally showed up on my driveway one day and he's been around for 5.5 years.
Playing badminton and flag football. Used to play a bunch of others, including soccer, tennis, and rugby. If you watch the NFL, I'm a massive Eagles fan :eagle:.
Cooking frequently (this includes hosting cookathons). Also unwinding with puzzles (Puzzled Pint anyone?), board games, video games, escape rooms, traveling, and beach excursions.
previous work:
Energy systems and software engineering, parlayed into a data science (sorry, I meant "AI") background
An assortment of random work experiences: worked at a solar PV startup, built up the renewable energy division of a West African regional electrical engineering services firm, survived Amazon, did research in a VR lab
Created my own startup, RealScope, in 2015, focused on data-driven insights for real estate investors and developers
Transitioned to venture capital, first building data-driven models, then being a "normal" early-stage investor
Founded my own venture syndicate, Fourth Realm, in 2020 while I was still maintaining my day job as a partner at a multi-billion AUM VC firm :shushing_face:
exploring:
Optimizing energy systems (e.g. grid) through ML-driven optimization; more broadly, startup ideas in energy and climate.
Improving human capital and upskilling workforces in emerging markets through ML/AI applications and training.
To be honest, anything startup-wise or tech-transfer-wise in emerging markets. On the side, I run a non-profit called STAC (Science Technology Advisory Council), which for the last 30 years has been focused on tech transfer and startup ecosystem creation in the Philippines.
what I can help with:
Startup fundraising strategies, feedback, techniques, material prep, pitch prep; pretty much anything investor-facing for your startup
GTM and other general questions about building or expanding in Southeast Asia
Travel planning and tour itineraries

Software-guy: IBM Global Services.
What I can help with:
Decrypting legal advice
I’m low-key obsessed with good management/leadership

Hi everyone! A belated hello to the SPC community. 
@Luis Voloch
, Sahil Sud, and I recently founded Jimini Health to help solve the mental health crisis here and abroad, one of the foundational problems of our time.
We’re leveraging cutting-edge ML, mobile, and research from the world’s leading psychologists to rethink the anxiety care model, and so far, the results have been terrific.
We’ve launched and are treating dozens of clients. Let us know if you’re interested in care (or know anyone else who would be — as long as they’re in CA, CO, PA, or FL), or if you want to give us feedback.
I’ve been at this a long time, which is to say, I’m old. By the time I hired SPC’s beloved 
@Evan Tana
 as an undergraduate intern, I was on my third startup. To this day, Evan’s a great friend, and I take full credit for all his success. :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: Evan was also responsible for introducing me to 
@Ditty
 and 
@ruchi
many years ago; thank you, sir.
My bio:
I’ve built and run companies for thirty years. In 1994, I founded Small World Sports, the world’s first online fantasy sports business, which I sold to Paul Allen’s The Sporting News. In 1995, I spun out one of the world’s first web agencies, which I sold to iXL before its 1998 IPO. We're pretty sure we built the first stateful website in the world, but we have no way to prove this (largely useless) milestone.
In 2003, Trip Hawkins convinced me to move to the Bay Area to co-found mobile games pioneer Digital Chocolate. Sadly, we're best known today for driving off the team that built SuperCell / Clash of Clans.
I spent two years at loopt as the EVP and adult supervision for Sam Altman (Sam didn’t need the help). Sam may have started OpenAI, but I spent at least 70 weeks atop the loopt ping-pong ladder.
I was the CEO of mobile VOIP pioneer iSkoot, which I sold to Qualcomm in 2010.
I spent four years as the CUEO at Guardant Health before its IPO and was the CBO for Immunai, an AI-driven biotech at the intersection of ML and genomics that raised more than $300M. More importantly, that’s where I met 
@Luis Voloch
.
I concentrated in Computer Science at Harvard, back when only 12 students per year (!!) thought that was a good idea. In 1989, I took an AI class with Barabra Grosz, where we used expert systems for NLP; all I remember is, “This will never work.” I wasn't entirely wrong.
I live on the Stanford campus with my wife (who does cool stuff with CRISPR) and our adorable 2yo and 8yo daughters. (edited)

About me:
Work Related:
Hi I’m Sawyer! I most recently was a software engineer working at Figma for 4 years. I worked on a lot of different things. I’m often known for being the first engineer on FigJam, but I spent time working on Figma’s extensibility system, Dev Mode, some soon to be announced products (:eyes:Config :eyes:), and the Prototyping team with 
@Jamie Wong
 and 
@Andrew Chan
!
I’ve actually been an engineer in the design tooling space for a while. Before that I was working on a web based design tool at Facebook for 3.5 years.
Not work related:
I’m deepish into coffee! Do not get into it. There was a time when I was fine with instant coffee and now I have spent too much money on equipment and getting beans shipped from Japan.
I’m into music production. I have a vaporwave alias that I occasionally publish music under. Now I mostly make music for myself.
I’m into games! Currently obsessed with Balatro, but I just beat it on the highest difficulty so I need something new. Fun fact I originally got into programming because I ran an MMO private server with 1000s of users off an old desktop computer when I was in middle school.
What I’m Exploring:
I’m interested in all sorts of non-chat based ways to interact with llms. I’ve also been playing with generating UI using llms for a few months now. Here is some stuff that I’ve tinkering with:
A test bench for generating html using llms
This project of turning a doodle into ui
My dumb ai generated windows 9X simulator
This NLP IDE that lets you describe React components and get them to hook them together
You can tell when I’m building because I post it on twitter
How I can help:
I know too much about Typescript / Javascript / React / Web stuff. I know a lot about iframes / securing untrusted code in a browser. I’ve been told I’m fast at prototyping so always down to help jam on something. I know a lot about Vaporwave.

Hi folks - excited to join you all. I’m in the SF office, and I live in Upper Noe Valley - ping if you’re ever walking Sanchez and want a buddy!
Some wanderings before SPC:
Early at 3 startups in a variety of roles - started briefly in engineering at the very beginning, then a mish mosh of product management, growth and marketing, business development, and sales. Whatever was needed and I could passably help with :sweat_smile:
One of the first product managers at Quora, eventually led the product and sales functions as an exec team member. Pros and cons to that less common combo I can share if curious. In one phase there I built the ads product with my cross-functional partners, if ads generally are of interest
Most recently led product, growth, data, and science at Finch Care, a tamagotchi-meets-self-care consumer startup. Subscription based product that we grew to profitability through ads and product-led growth
What else?
Father to a strong-willed 2 year old daughter whom I absolutely adore
After pulling my lower back lifting said daughter, and reading Outlive, trying to figure out how the whole weight training thing works
Enjoy playing tennis, or pickleball with those who play that instead
Have struggled with depression (runs in the family), always open to talking about it
So what’s next?
Exploring the mental health and wellness space with direct to consumer applications
Brushing off incredibly rusty coding skills :joy: Also debating whether I should team up with others instead
Keeping an open mind to see if anything else piques my interest before committing to a direction given how much AI is opening up
What can I help with?
I often experience imposter syndrome so my knee jerk reaction to this given the strength of the community is probably not much? But I’ve advised a couple startups and coached a couple individuals and they didn’t fire me so something I said may have been useful. If anything in my background seems relevant, or if you want a sounding board for anything, always happy to chat

Danni (Danqing) Zhang

Hello everyone, this is Danni (Danqing) Zhang. You can call me Danni. Very excited to be part of SPC.
Myself:
I came from Harbin, northeastern China, known as the city of snow. I spent 4 years in Beijing for my undergraduate studies before I moved to the Bay Area for my PhD and my job in 2014.
I live with my husband and our ginger cat, Danny (he got the name from shelter, not because I am Danni), in Burlingame, but I also rent an apartment in SF and live in SF from Tuesday to Friday to explore startup opportunities and meet interesting people.
In the past 10+ years, I proactively made several pivots and have successfully transitioned across various technical domains. My personal website: https://danqingz.github.io/, linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/danni-zhang5/
I held different titles during my graduate studies and my professional career: machine learning engineer, researcher, applied scientist, PM, or manager. But I think, in essence, I am just a hacker and builder.
What you're currently exploring
Exploring opportunities in the AI agent space and open to different projects. Several projects that I have been working on include: Data Labeling Explainable Agent, Coding Agent, AutoML AI Agent, AIOS/LLMOS.
Interested in B2B developer tools and open-source projects.
Topics members can ask you about
I am looking for hackers and builders to learn and build things together.
I am generally quite knowledgeable about AIML. If you have questions about NLP, search, recommendation systems, computational advertising, smart cities, LLMs, and AI agents, I can provide my opinions.
I taught myself many things over the past 10+ years. If you are learning technical subjects and would like some suggestions, I might be helpful.
Personal interests:
I learned drawing from ages 6 to 12, mostly because of my name. My Chinese name, 丹青 (Danqing), has a special meaning. According to its Wikipedia page: "In Chinese painting, danqing (Chinese: 丹青; pinyin: dān qīng) refers to paintings on silk and Xuan paper."
I was very active in marathons before the pandemic and participated in the 2019 SF half marathon, but stopped in 2020. I want to pick it up this year and have already participated in the Oakland 5K. I am now preparing for the SF half marathon.
I have no experience at all, but I am hoping to find non-VC-backable side projects as an income source.
I feel that robotics with AI agent is the future, if one day I become really really rich and successful, I most probably will go to grad school again to get a PhD in robotics and run a robotics startup at the same time.

Joining #spc-bay-area this week, psyched to get to know you all!
About me
Grew up in :gb:London; then Boston for 6 years (PhD @ MIT); now in SF (part-time @ Stanford)
Academic background is ~50% machine learning, and ~50% social science research on belief & attitude change
Worked for Swayable creating ad-testing & polling technology for Democrats
Started Rhetorical Labs: a research collective building tools to help advocacy & public-health orgs optimize their messaging
AI-safety consulting for OpenAI & AISI, evaluating the capabilities of frontier LLMs to persuade the public on political issues
Currently exploring
Simulating human experiments with LLMs (treatmenteffect.app)
Trying to escape academia and build something really crazy at the intersection of LLMs + advocacy/persuasion/adtech. I have the technical background but no experience with the startup/VC world, so I'm hoping to learn & meet people @ SPC!
Something I've built recently
Crowdvocate.org: a platform for persuasive-message-writing tournaments. The setup is that an org sponsors a tournament, chooses their goal (e.g. increase support for climate policies) and then our users compete to write the most effective message for a cash prize (messages are tested in randomized experiments with ~30,000 U.S. adults)
Talk to me about
Anything about LLMs & persuasion, chatbots etc (I keep an ongoing meta-analysis covering all the published studies I know of & various unpublished ones too)
Current academic research on political ads; microtargeting, etc
Expert forecasting, Bayesian models, survey & polling methods
Trying to do research & build tech for societal benefit, while navigating dual-use risks
Personal interests / photo
I spent 6 months after grad school cycling around the country with my partner and our pet rat. We planned to make it back to Boston but kinda fell in love with the California coast and never finished the trip... so now here I am! (Pics of Mochi attached) (edited)

@Ditty
 Agree, immigrating is crazy but one of the most rewarding things i’ve done. I’ve immigrated (emigrated?) more than once lol! and by now if I were to move again I don’t think i’d have the same feelings of longing, uprooting, missing or feeling foreign. I truly consider myself a citizen of the world now, and as such, by definition, can’t emigrate if you are not crossing a (literal, or emotional) border.
We are ultimately way more alike than we are different, is what i have learned and profoundly believe.

Hi everyone, joining in SF this week and excited to meet you all!
About me
Grew up in the East Bay, undergrad at Stanford. I've spent time living in New York, Taipei, and Mumbai.
My professional experience focuses on enterprise saas applications that are data-heavy and involve applied ML or NLP. I've been in product or implementation roles for the past 10+ years.
I spent 4 very formative years on the frontlines of Palantir's early commercial (non-gov) business, leading development of analysis tools at Fortune 100 customers.
Later led data and ML work at DataFox, a startup that helped b2b GTM teams with CRM data enrichment and TAM expansion. We were acquired by Oracle in 2018. Post-acquisition I led the roll-out of DataFox internally to Oracle's global sales & marketing organizations.
At DraftWise (YC S20), a start-up building an AI-enabled legal drafting assistant, I led successful pilots with top-tier law firms.
Currently exploring
Enterprise LLM applications, focusing on data analysis and business intelligence. To what extent can LLM applications perform tasks currently done by management consultants?
How can LLM agents help human analysts interface with data? I'm interested in the code-generation ability of LLMs to generate interacative data visualizations on the fly, in real time.
I've been prototyping here: https://www.polymetricapp.com/ (very much a work in progress!)
Ask me about
Early stage b2b product development
Delivering outcomes in an enterprise pilot
Prototyping with LLMs
Legal tech
Personal interests
Running, reading, being in nature, traveling, trying new recipes, eating delicious food, TV/movies.

About Me
Born and raised in Delhi, India; lived briefly in Australia before moving to the US.
Studied at CMU in Pittsburgh; worked and lived in Seattle and the Bay Area for the last 15 years.
Started at Amazon as a software engineer; worked on the email marketing platform, retail platform, and AWS.
Founded two companies (one in consumer social and the other in B2B SaaS); learned that building a product is far easier than achieving product-market fit, so starting with the "what" and "why" is crucial.
Later worked as a founding engineer for a logistics platform startup, MileZero (Ex-Amazon team), which was later acquired by Capstone Logistics.
Most recently headed the engineering teams at LinkedIn Premium Subscriptions and Ads Advertiser Experience.
I live in Redwood City with my wife and two kids (daughter 4, son 1).
During my parental leave last year, I built an AI storyteller for my daughter, which she loves. You can create your own personalized story at http://my-ai-story-book.com . This project rekindled my passion for building from scratch and solidified my decision to dive back into the startup world!
Exploring:
(Main)Enterprise SaaS
An AI-powered platform that enables real-time resource visibility insights in product development, business performance observability, and feature impact for FP&A, Product, and Engineering leadership in companies with >50 engineers
(Other Ideas)
Consumer Social Ideas ( Copilot for Parents, GenAI-assisted Auto-Biography for everyone)
Prosumer/B2B SaaS (AI Insights Dashboard for real estate buying, Shopify for Subscriptions: to help build, manage, and grow Prosumer subscription businesses)
Ask Me About:
Product questions about:
Subscription businesses serving job seekers, recruiters, small businesses, and learners
Ads/Marketing Tech
Product-Led Growth
Last Mile Logistics Platforms
Retail Tech (although my knowledge is a bit dated now)
Engineering questions; I used to be mainly a backend developer with data/ML experience. I didn’t code in my last job at LinkedIn but did full time in my previous startup (MileZero).

Hey everyone! Onboarded about 2 weeks ago in NYC and finally getting around to this!
 About Me
I’m based in NYC on the UWS. Moved here for my PhD in late 2018 and have been here ever since!
I just finished my PhD in December 2023 at Columbia.
My thesis was focused on AI in healthcare (building better methods to use multi-modal imaging data for early detection of disease).
fun fact: part of my work is being piloted in one of the first clinical trials of an AI model in the clinic!
Briefly worked on deploying LLMs at NewYork-Presbyterian hospital for a summarization task.
I’ve also spent time building software at Counsyl (now Myriad genetics), a genetic counseling company, and Tempus, where I built machine learning pipelines.
Exploring
Working on building a company with my co-founder 
@Tony Sun
 to improve the appointment booking experience for health visits (price transparency, automated booking with AI agents etc.).
Very interested in understanding how to sell point solutions in the employee benefits marketplace and incentives at play there.
Ask me about
Deploying AI models in healthcare settings
Working with healthcare data (claims, EHR)
Health economics and incentives structures
The potential of LLMs to disrupt the healthcare space
Multi-modal computer vision models
 Outside of Work
Love the outdoors (being the bay area transplant I am) — so hiking/cycling/running are staple weekend activities.
Relatively new to climbing (a little less than a year) but loving it so far!

Hi hello! Working with 
@Luke Mercado
 as an affiliate in SF on Interpersonal Work.
Background
Over the last ten years I’ve switched from arts to software in pursuit of impact; from web to mobile to be closer to the user; from application development to platform/infrastructure in pursuit of technical mastery; from public company to Series A to learn how to make the “sausage”; towards culture to find personal, spiritual alignment; and now, finally, to startup founder-ship for a blend of pro-social impact and “home-building”.
Exploring
Using AI to elevate every (eng|product|sales) team to be as effective as the highest performing team in an org.
“Look forward to Monday”
AI to help people help (care for) other people
Pro-social social networks
What I can help with:
Culture (as in teams)

Hey all! I’ll be joining SPC tomorrow as part of the SF office! I’m currently exploring ideas around a few pain points for long tail SMBs (specifically - scheduling & bookkeeping). I’ve started a few companies before, but its my first time doing very intentional ideation!

Community as a growth lever - we leveraged this heavily at HubHaus
Building & Scaling teams/culture - especially from the 5 -> 30 phase
I have industry experience in co-living (real-estate-y), fintech, and legal/policy (ran product for a 150 person team for legal stuff at Google), so happy to share insights from any of these!

Hi everyone!
I'm excited to be joining SPC tomorrow at the SF office.
About Me:
I was born in Washington DC and have most recently lived in Minnesota (undergrad) and Nashville (masters & start-up). I'm brand new to the SF area!
My last start-up, Atmos AI, was a TurboTax-like solution for small-cap public and middle-market companies to assist with ESG, carbon accounting, and broader corporate sustainability reporting. We were acquired by a sustainability consulting firm earlier this year and I've been helping them integrate the tech up until recently.
I invest in and advise a small number of startups in the sustainability and compliance space, where I can add value with my niche network that I've built.
Since my start-up was acquired, I've been diving deeper into the construction industry and working alongside my family's smaller-scale commercial and residential general contracting business, as well as with my older brother, who manages large $1b+ commercial and industrial projects in the DC-Metro area.
What I'm Working On:
Coming from a finance and sustainability background, I've been blown away by how outdated the tech is in everything that's done in construction. I dug into agentic AI applications during the OpenAI/SPC hackathon as my project and plan to explore additional forms and how they can be applied within the construction industry for larger firms.
Additionally, I've taken a step back from ESG reporting due to the polarization I constantly encountered as a founder. I'm very bullish on energy and grid management though and am interested in exploring opportunities if anyone is similarly interested or working within that space.
What I Can Help With:
If there's anything related to sustainability, impact, or ESG reporting, I'm your guy.
If I can be helpful with team building in the 5-20 range, I'd love to give input and lessons that I learned along the way, especially when building out GTM teams.
Before starting Atmos, I received my master's in finance and briefly worked in PE. I spent a lot of time in financial models and am happy to give a second opinion on almost anything in that space.
Personal Interests:
I'm a former collegiate ice hockey player and most recently the head coach at Vanderbilt University. I'm looking to continue playing in the SF area if anyone has a recommendation for a rec team.
I'm planning to climb Mt. Aconcagua over the upcoming Christmas/NYE holiday, which will be my second of the Seven Summits raising money for a foundation very close to my younger brother and me.
I recently completed an 18-month Schoolie conversion and just returned from our first two-week nomad trip over the July 4th holiday. I'll be in and around the SF office, as well as visiting some CA National Parks in the coming months to help break it in.
I have two dogs and am super passionate about new pet gadgets and tech. Whether it's dog treadmills, activity trackers, or new types of accessories, I'm a total nerd for all of it.
I'm looking forward to meeting everyone in person, both in SF and in NYC when I can make it out there.

Hi everyone, I'm Yurong. I joined as an SPC member yesterday. I'm exploring and building at the intersection of Marketing, AI/Analytics, and SaaS. Thrilled to join the SPC community—and potentially find someone who'd love to build together!
About me:
From: Grew up in the northwest part of China (Lanzhou, a place with amazing hand-pulled noodles :ramen:). Moved to the bay area seven years ago.
Now: Living in San Mateo with my husband and two-year-old son:standing_person:.
Background: I've spent the last decade in marketing and data science across various sectors like consumer goods, SaaS, e-commerce, and MarTech provider. I recently wrapped up my journey at Asana, where I founded and led Marketing Data Science.
Education: I transitioned from Marketing to Marketing Data Science after obtaining my first master's in Data Science. I'm almost done with my second master (MSCS) from Georgia Tech after grinding it out part-time for the last six years.
Exploring & Building right now:
I'm a first-time founder who took the plunge into the startup world three months ago.
Problem space: Intersection of Marketing, AI/Analytics, and SaaS. Digital paid advertising especially for Marketing.
Current idea: Maxma.ai - privacy-friendly, incrementality-based (a.k.a., best-in-class :slightly_smiling_face:) advertising measurement that was previously only accessible to big enterprises now made accessible for businesses of all sizes. After stand-alone measurement offering, measurement + [Gen AI ad creative/programmatic ad buying/...] for the future version of end-to-end paid advertising workflow that can reduce the industry’s wasted ad spend and accelerate growth for businesses of all sizes especially SMBs, small enterprises, and anyone in between.
Ask me about:
Marketing & Growth: Paid advertising, user acquisition, marketing and growth analytics, SaaS growth strategies.
Data Science: Experimentation, measurement & attribution, statistics, machine learning.
Early motherhood, parenting
Personal Interests:
My personal hobbies took a backseat post-motherhood and founding a startup. Nowadays, if I'm not working, I'm mostly exploring new eats, playgrounds, and places to visit with my kiddo.
Really happy to be here and can't wait to connect with you soon!

Hi everyone, I'm Jonathan and I'm happy to be joining the community! A bit about me:
:bridge_at_night: I'm a long time product designer in the Bay, currently living in Mill Valley
:art: Design school undergrad at RISD, Business School MBA at Harvard
:kr: I've lived in Seoul, Tokyo and New York in the past
:man-woman-girl-boy: 2 kids, 4 y/o girl Suji and 10 m/o boy Taeo
:bell: Originally from outside of Philadelphia
:briefcase: Alum at Facebook, Cruise, Patreon
:camera_with_flash: Created a lot of the Facebook photos experience, Facebook Portal
:car: Led the consumer design team at Cruise (ridehail and in-car experience)
:art: Led the consumer design team at Patreon
:bulb: Design advisor for a few companies right now — ElectronX (https://www.electronx.com) and Woven (https://www.getwoven.com)
:classical_building: Back in the day I created the first design conference at Harvard
What I'm currently exploring:
:robot_face: Generative interfaces! I'm working with my Co-Founder Adam on Canopy — we're starting w/ AI powered product search / product reviews
:male-detective: 50% of internet searchers use Google to find new products, but this experience is more fragmented than ever and is very time consuming (dozens of links, dozens of open tabs). They also spend a large amount of time sifting through the deluge of content shouting for their attention, making it very difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff.
:sparkles: What we think would be way better: Beautifully designed, curated, just-in-time review pages that have read everything for you and present it in the right format.
:bar_chart: We think there's a huge opportunity to create the canonical product page / review / guide for products (making it far easier for consumers)
:speech_balloon: Imaging a product page that is always up-to-date, shows you what the internet says about that product, and provides context for you to query about / adjacent to that product.
:rocket: Ultimately, we hope to build a much more robust way for brands and companies to manage data and UI for how they show up in AI chat, and also understand who their best customers are via a taste graph we can build based on how customers use our AI. These customers are far higher intent than generic internet 2.0 search and will use next-gen SEO (we call it AICO for AI chat optimization).
Topics you can ask me about:
:art: Design, Figma, UI, Brand, Aesthetics, Prototyping
:busts_in_silhouette: Hiring, team building, product
:man-woman-girl-boy: Parenting
:ocean: I'm also always down to chat about my passions and interests (I have way too many): espresso, camping, breakfast, wine, furniture making, home audio, Big Sur, ceramics / pottery, photography, and anything ocean related (surfing, sailing, diving) (edited)

Heyo! What's up? I'm Chris and I just joined SPC SF. :saluting_face:
About me
32 y/o, just moved to SF from the UK :gb:
This year I have been to Colombia (twice), Brazil, Panama, Prague, Vienna, Spain and I drove from England to Ukraine to deliver some cars for the war effort (and then promptly left).:man-running:
My next venture would be my 5th. I've been a founding engineer one company, a CTO at another, an around boot-strapper at another, and a CEO at my latest. Two of these are still operating and two of them were acquired.
I like nothing more than to laugh at really dumb jokes (mostly my own) :smile:
Currently exploring
I am most interested in meeting a co-founder I vibe with to build something big. I am most experienced in regulated fintech but really I will choose person over idea any day!
On the side I'm building a bootstrapped company on the side in crypto token analytics with my brother because frankly this is an easy way to make money (I started and sold one business this way already). I actually really dislike crypto (sorry). But it's fun to program with.
Recently I've been getting back to coding after a stint of being a CEO. I think I'm best as a CT(P)O and I think that's the right role for me on my next thing. Although I have transferrable skills from both disciplines.
Ask me about
B2B and cross-border payments. I just spent a lot of time building in this space.
All things fintech. :zap:
A funny story, I have many.
Personal interests
I have been intensely learning Spanish for a year now and I'm pretty good! I take all opportunities to practice.
Getting to know California and SF. I'm still new here. :wave-animated:
Having a good time. In my heart of hearts I'm an introvert but I love causing mischief with people.
Here's a photo of me fast asleep at the Polish/Ukraine border - hopefully dispelling any idea there were any acts of bravery and in fact at times was really quite mundane (the bureaucracy at this border was crazy)

Hey SPC!
I'm Braulio and am thrilled to join this community of builders. I work a couple days a week from the SF office. You might have seen me around with a VR Meta Quest headset, I'm long due to introduce myself.
About Me
34 y/o. Been on the bay area for about 9 years, but I'm originally from Mexico :flag-mx:
I've been very focused on building VR games fulltime for the past 4+ years. And before that I used to work at Google as a Software Engineer.

Happy Monday SPC!!
I’m Jon, a bit of an overdue introduction as have been out since our onboarding day:
About Me
40 years old. Grew up in Colorado, went to UT-Austin, and have been in bay for about 18 years.
Started as a founder in the whole web 2.0 and Facebook Dev ecosystem back in 2008 building out sports apps. Through a few acquisitions, ended up at Yahoo!
Spent the next decade as co-founder/cto of InfoScout (now branded as Numerator). We pioneered a new way to build what’s called a consumer purchase panel, in turn allowing cpg brands to understanding purchase behavior at higher fidelities than they were ever able to. We were acquired by PE and today the company is duking it without the legacy giants in the space, notably Nielsen.
Co-founded Cascade, a no-code tool that attempted to give non engineers data superpowers that historically have required one to learn python or advanced sql. Many GTM challenges and ultimately not successful → learnings here.
Co-owner OnTheSnow - digital media ski business.
Exploring
I have an affinity for solving more ‘main street’ problems (thus the historical work with cpg brands) with strong tech.
I’ve been exploring an idea that allows food & bev brands to turn the corner from pushing brand awareness advertising on social (doesn’t work as well given the attention spans on social) into in-store sales and performance advertising → marketing site.
Based on excitement from cpg brands on an ancillary feature of Snag, I’m considering pivoting away. The potential concept is how to do you perform qualitative market research at scale. Market research has long been confined to either scalable structured surveys (good for ‘what’ questions) or qualitative research like focus groups (good for ‘why’ questions). But do LLMs now allow you to effectively perform qual research proactively at scale?
Outside of Work
Skiing, basketball, biking, golf, & college football fanatic (:the_horns: hook em)
Adjusting to burb life after two decades in the city (queue endless house projects)
My wife and I’s two dogs (below). A bit of a beauty and the beast duo

Hi friends, I recently joined SPC in New York, and have been blown away so far! I’ve started a couple of things before and I’ve always longed for a community like this. I love sharing ideas and helping out, so please reach out any time – this gives me massive energy :boom:.
Also, the people here are insanely talented, accomplished, driven, and nice. This is a wild opportunity.
About me
:flag-za: South African, now living in New York (East Village)
:earth_asia: Career Phase I: Emerging markets are leapfrogging the world (less relevant now)
Started my career at a top-3 global equity fund focusing on small-caps in emerging markets. Got hired as an admin assistant and automated my job so that I could be promoted to an analyst. After 3-years, I was responsible for $100m+. Really crazy times during the GFC. 
Worked on the acquisition and integration of the once-largest social platform in Africa, mostly on feature phones.
:chart_with_upwards_trend: Career Phase 2: Tech enables unbounded opportunities
Founded a social shopping app that raised funding from a Google incubator and I got my first taste of Silicon Valley. I fell in love with the American Dream.
Joined McKinsey to get my Green Card and move to the US. At McKinsey, I launched a Netflix competitor in New Zealand and a telco in Uganda, designed the inbuilt apps on the Samsung Galaxy; increased subscription revenue at The New Yorker; developed growth strategy at Yahoo and Android; etc. Moved to SF then NY. Won the highest non-partner award for developing tech to manage large-scale organizational transformations that was rolled out to clients all over the world (basically tech to drive behavioral change).
:female-singer::skin-tone-2: Career Phase 3: People are fascinating and consumer brands shape culture
Co-founded a consumer beverage brand. Went on Shark Tank; covered in the NYT; partnered with Lululemon and Victoria’s Secret. Launched in Japan. Learnt a ton about ecomm and brands.
Co-founded platform for creators to launch ecommerce brands from their phones in <60min. Raised capital from Forerunner Ventures and Atomic. Moved to LA.
Co-founded social app with Hollywood actress to make online conversations feel like real-world interactions. Raised funding from a bunch of amazing investors including Ev Williams (Twitter), Kevin Lin (Twitch), and Cameron Winklevoss. Also built a social quiz app and a Cameo competitor.
:heartpulse: Things I enjoy: Food (I’m in the top 0.5% on Beli); running; strength training; style; reading (fiction); podcasts; Citibiking; people and cultural shifts; budget travel; caffeine.
:iphone: Fave apps rn: Airbuds; Bump; Beli; Stompers; Rise Sleep; TikTok.
:i_love_you_hand_sign: Vibes: Curious; super high energy; creative, obsessive, disciplined, empathetic, bias to action.
:octopus: Ask me about
Consumer / consumer social.
Brand / design.
Creators: I started a creator company and co-founded a startup with a celebrity.
Ecommerce: I run a brand and am very well-connected in this space.
Go-to-market / growth: I’ve started a few TikTok accounts and know the broader growth marketing toolkit.
:space_invader: Spaces I am exploring
Digital twins: Live more than one life - yes please.
Consumer (& consumer social): AI apps that bring people together, rather than replace friends. I like apps that are really fun and addictive. Status + flirting + stalking = DAU.
AI coaches: I didn’t grow up in an environment where it was always easy to get great advice on a bunch of things. I am really excited about the potential to up-level people with coaches. There are a lot of spaces this could be applied to, e.g., AI business manager for creators; AI career coach.
Future of work: As a person from a fairly non-traditional, international background, I’m passionate about creating a more efficient job market. I've also hired a bunch and hiring sucks.
Really low friction content creation.
I want to create simple, delightful user experiences, and am looking to start a transformative company.

hi everyone! my team 
@Eddie
 
@Emir Akdere
 and I are based in SF and recently joined the upcoming fall cohort of the Founder Fellowship :slightly_smiling_face: we've been loving the creative, collaborative, and zany :llama::llama::llama: energy of SPC
Personal history + fun facts
from Queens NY, went to undergrad in CT, moved to SF in 2021
at yale, I majored in CS but spent most of my time producing theatre and lighting designing (and continue to do so for a 35 y/o pageant in the Bay!)
I've been published in NYT and been featured on NPR
Work history
did software and product internships at Bloomberg, Stripe, and Salesforce
was part of the second inaugural class of Salesforce's APM program, during which I did greenfield product strategy for sales, API, and SMB products
last fall, I quit Salesforce and did a classic first-time-founder foray into consumer social, making a content curation platform for books/movies/articles. I thought, experimented, shipped lots, but ultimately decided to shut it down. My post-mortem manifesto got me some consulting gigs tho! :moneyparrot:
I probably have enough expertise at this point to give good/novel advice on
consumer social (here's my manifesto)
consumer GTM (tl;dr it's short form content all the way down)
content creation (I grew my Instagram from 6k -> 22k in a month) :selfie::skin-tone-3:
b2b sales and SMB personas as they pertain to CRM (I did product for the "startup-within-Salesforce" that pioneered an SMB offering to compete with Hubspot)
Currently
Eddie, Emir, and I are doing 1-2 week sprints and building a new MVP roughly every sprint. We're interested in
consumer/pro-sumer tools for augmenting human creativity and ability
general purpose agents :robot_face:
future of work (e.g. content generation, enabling solopreneurs)
Follow to be periodically reminded I exist on
Twitter
Instagram
Our team's Substack (updates every other week)
lastly, a tweet that's been really top of mind for me recently lol

Background:
Grew up in NY
Mechanical and Aerospace engineer turned biologist, genomicist in my PhD at MIT
Worked as an ML intern at Apple
Started a YC S18 company Coral Genomics (diagnostics to predict which medications would work best for autoimmune patients)
After 4 years, this company was acquihired by Gordian Bio where I served as head of VP of Technology
Currently exploring:
A drug discovery/development company focused on discovering novel drug combinations for cancer. There are 20k genes, 200 million pairs of genes, and 1.3 trillion three way combinations…it’s an exponential (needle in haystack) search problem and I believe it requires a combination of massive data generation and ML to solve.
Personal interests:
Running in golden gate park
Playing with our dog Tosci (see pic)
Facilitating philosophy clubs
Planes (have pilot’s license, but haven’t flown much recently)
Other members can ask me about:
biotech (diagnostics, therapeutics)
connections to people in those spaces
AI x bio
moneyball for predicting which drugs will work or not in clinical trials

Abby Chao
  5:13 PM
Hey everyone! I’m Abby Chao based in San Francisco.
Background – Most recently I was the CEO of 3x logistics SaaS businesses, including Record360 which we sold in February. Prior to that, I was a cofounder of a fintech/edtech startup called Backer and started my career at McKinsey. I’m originally from the Chicago suburbs and graduated from USC and Stanford GSB.
Currently exploring – I’m open to anything software and really looking to explore a lot of different ideas. My sweet spots are fintech, edtech, and workforce development and I’m keen to continue working in B2B SaaS.
Personal interests - snowboarding, surfing, tennis, meditation, memoirs, figuring out life with kids (I’ve got a 15 month old and twins on the way!)
Ask me about:
hiring, building/running teams
B2B SaaS, particularly strategy and go-to-market
VC vs. PE
selling a company

Hi folks! Really excited to be part of the SPC community.
Background:
Raised mostly in Oregon, college / grad school in Midwest (Carleton / Northwestern).
PhD in Applied Math
But now think of myself more as a scientist / immunologist.
Came out to SF for a postdoc but joined a research non-profit (The Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy) and was there for 5 years as a group leader.
Along the way co-founded Immunai and helped build the therapeutic discovery team.
Most recently was a co-founder at Santa Ana Bio developing new therapies for autoimmune disease.
Exploring
Remain most interested at the intersection of data / ML / AI and biology / immunology / therapeutics.
How can we ideate and validate new therapeutic ideas faster and more efficiently?
How can we leverage data tools to disentangle the immense complexity that is the human / mammalian immune system?
What is the most efficient path to developing new therapeutics?
Can we build a path to cure autoimmune diseases, for good??
Personally
Dad of two kiddos so spend a lot of time trying to remember the various Paw Patrol pups or now the Super Kitties.
In general actually pretty into parenting and thinking about mentoring and teaching but to 4 year olds.
Multi-generational home and also very into that.
Into distance running although nursing a knee injury right now.
Live in Berkeley near campus.
Amateur cocktail enthusiast.
Ask me about
Company building (esp in life sciences!!)
Immunology / science of all kinds
The intersection of data, biology and therapeutics ("Techbio"?)
Fun things to do across the bridge :slightly_smiling_face:
Picture
Hiking with our oldest (Charlie) - 5 mile hike for a 4 year old! (The secret: an obsene amount of snacks)
At the beach (although in the winter - our littlest Alexander is much bigger now!)

Hello! Joined the SF crew today. Here's some info about me -
Background
Born in Delhi
Moved to the US to study systems at Carnegie Mellon
Work
Focus on Operating Systems x Distributed Systems. Currently Platform x AI
Expertise in Linux Sandboxing, Containers, VMs etc.
Worked at Microsoft (2 years) -> Google (8 years; Chrome OS) -> Replit (1 year)
My team at Google invented Rust based VMMs (crosvm) that power MicroVMs (AWS Firecracker, Lambda)
At Replit - you're proxied through my service whenever you code. Also helped prototype first version of RAG based code chat.
Exploring
Secure code execution environments for AI Agents
VM based DAG frameworks for AI Agents
Interests
I was a quizzer growing up so I have broad interests :slightly_smiling_face:
Sports and Cinema are top interests
I write screenplays on the side (also took a class at CCSF) and I want to write a web series in the future.
Love snorkeling whenever I get a chance
Talk to me about
Infrastructure, Operating Systems, MicroVMs, Containers, Linux Sandboxing, AI Agents
If you're feeling low and need a sounding board. I am told I'm a good listener :slightly_smiling_face:

Replit — More Reliable Connections to Your Repls
At Replit, session success rate is one of our service level objectives (SLOs). This means that any legitimate incoming request from a client should always be successfully connected to its target Repl. Failure to do so is a bad user experience.
To abstract away intermittent infrastructure failures when you connect to a Repl, we use a reverse WebSocket proxy between the user’s client and the remote VM hosting Conman, our container manager that runs all Repls in a container. The high-level view of this proxying looks something like this:
In the above diagram, Regional Goval Cluster represents our backend, which is sharded per region for scale and to prevent cross-region latency and egress costs… Show more

hey y’all!  I just joined the SF ccrew.
Background
I’m a corrupted neuroscientist from Indiana.  I used to do connectomics research with PNI and some peripheral nervous system modeling with CTRL-Labs.  Most recently, I spent a year at a startup finding out that input-space contrastive methods for neural EBMs are a really bad idea.
What I’m exploring
Computational models of cooking and botany mad science.  I grow tasty things at home and think that modern academia needs to start making impact in my kitchen.  I’m also digging into discrete program search, which is related to lots of efforts to get LLMs to be less dumb (e.g. ARC) but mostly motivated by my inability to play Pokemon at the top level.
Personal interests
General interests other than the rabbitholes above include making ice cream flavors based on savory spices.  Basil, avocado, everything bagel, and roasted garlic are some bangers.  Do not make rain-flavored ice cream; petrichor sounds romantic but tastes like catfish for neuroscience reasons, apparently.
What other members can ask me about
Cooking, turn-based strategy, musicology, neuroscience, probabilistic machine learning, botany, finance.  I don’t know that much so please factor that in.
Photos
Exploring SF street food and planting seeds at home. (edited)

Hey everyone! :wave: I just joined SPC as a member in SF. Very much looking forward to connecting with folks. A little on me:
Background
I'm a Canadian :flag-ca: transplant who has also spent time in Dallas, Chicago, and now SF (15 years and counting)
My background is predominately in Enterprise B2B, specifically building and leading several Product Management teams (1st PM in through scaling to a larger org)
Recently was the co-founder and CEO of an internal mobility/career development company called Flux. We were acquired by a company in the Recruiting space a couple years ago where I then served as GM of the business unit Flux became + SVP, Strategic Products (building new things across their entire product portfolio)
Prior to that I was the CPO turned CEO of an e-commerce company, and the head of Product of a video ad-tech company that eventually was acquired and became a division of Comcast (yay... but boo!)
I studied at UC Berkeley, DePaul (Chicago), and SMU (Dallas)
Currently Exploring
I'm early and all over the place but have been exploring a few ideas based on some recent personal experiences:
Family Estate & Digital Account Transfer (for lack of a better term) -> i.e. why isn't will/trust/estate planning as easy as TurboTax? I have 2 small kids and aging parents so I've personally been spending a lot of  time here and the general experience sucks
Commercial Real Estate as a general category (LLC formation and management for larger investments, land leasing/connections to corporate tenants, etc.)
I'm also generally interested in how AI could be applied to things like content ratings and curation for children specifically
Personal Interests
Travel anywhere that requires a passport, skiing, scuba diving, and home renovation
I'm also a father of 2 girls (3 & 8 years old) who my wife and I drag everywhere (my 8 year old has been to 30+ countries), a few pics below (Patagonia, Greece, Thailand)
Ask Me About
HRTech/Future of Work
Online Advertising & Media
Product Management in general, team building/development, hiring, fundraising, organizational design
How to travel the world with your children while maintaining your sanity

Hey everyone! I'm Jackson from SPC New York. Excited to get to know many of you and visit the SF space in early October
Background
Grew up in New Jersey, but spent a formative teenage year in Beijing with a host family that spoke no English. Later majored in Chinese in college.
I've only had two jobs since undergrad: management consultant (:grimacing:) and Founding CEO of a B2B edtech company called Mentor Collective
MC started as a pro bono side project and grew to serve 100s of customers and reach millions of students. We made the Inc 5000 list several times and are now breakeven with PE backing. Many, many mistakes were made along the way and I'm especially excited to carry those learnings into a new venture.
After 10 years leading MC, I promoted our Chief Product Officer to CEO in February and moved into a very lightweight Chairman role.
I'm now fresh off a period of travel (India, China, Singapore, Taiwan, UK), angel investing/advising (mostly mission-driven B2B SaaS) and reconnecting with all the important things I neglected during my first founder journey (relationships, family, health)
Exploring
Double bottom line businesses (social impact + profit)
B2B SaaS in edtech / workforce development / future of work
Scalable ways to drive social mobility for lower income Americans, particularly interested in: frontline workers, working parents, underemployed populations
Personal Interests
Spicy food (cooking + eating), soccer (playing and watching), fitness classes (~10 years late to discovering Classpass...), foreign languages
Ask me about
Selling to non profits, B2B GTM, Edtech, raising private equity, bootstrapping, impact investing
Some (food themed) pictures from recent travels:

Hey SPC squad! I’m Joe, based in NYC. If you see a guy wearing a pizza hat :pizza: in the office, it’s probably me so please say hi!
About Me
:earth_africa: Third culture kid: grew up in China, middle school in Nigeria, high school in Qatar, spent some time in Korea & Singapore too
:male-technologist: Spent 4 years at Snap working on iOS growth and did native iOS and cross-platform development. I ran some product and data aspects of my team, and set up the foundations for our client performance roadmap.
:books: I studied bachelors and masters in computer science at Penn.
:bricks: Prior to SPC, I solo built and launched a mobile product in ~1 month. Found early users myself and iterated on it before realizing I was tackling it from the wrong angle. I’ve learned a ton from that experience about what I like and don’t like, and hope to accelerate that learning process here with the SPC community.
Currently Exploring
Doing discovery on data problems with a focus on asset allocators
Actively trying to learn:
How to accelerate my learning
Asking the right questions in customer discovery / early sales
What motivates me: big problem / type of customer / innovation / independence
Trying to answer the question of which one (learning vs finding a problem) is more important for me at this stage. If anyone has gone through this in the past, I’d love to ask you about it!
Personal Interests
Calisthenics (former injured powerlifter healing my back)
Endurance training (philly marathon in nov and 9+1 nyc 2025)

Hello everyone - I'm Daanish, joining from SF!
background
Grew up in azad kashmir:snow_capped_mountain:. Got a scholarship to move here for school in 2013. At Stanford, I studied Electrical Engineering + English, worked on moonshot projects in hexacopter autonomy and integrated photonic circuits. Eventually felt that civilization is not yet ready to climb this tech tree, and became interested in how we could get there. Learnt from good leaders at nvidia (intelligent video group) and cerebra (retail analytics). My focus since then has been on collective agency and becoming: I ran a hacker-artist collective and a reading/education company. In this time I also travelled a bit, took a lot of wrong turns and encountered the incredible variation in human personality! Now I am excited to be back home, and settled once again in my favorite city in the world :foggy:
currently exploring
how “deepware” is changing our relationship to what we can know and engineer 
training recipes for "small", expert models today
knobs and dials for specifying training data; theory for statistical guarantees from it
principled games and experiences to help folks pick up new skills
talk to me about
recruiting and team composition 
managing yourself as a first time founder and manager
launching with inner and outer momentum
building product
i really love small talk: the weather, the city, the online, the offline (:partly_sunny:) -- all good subjects!
personal
In my free time i enjoy swimming, reading and writing.  Recently i've been identifying as a scene cartographer as I am prone to mapping both emerging scenius and scenes from history

Ritika Tawani
  2:48 AM
Hey guys, This is Ritika, joining the Bengaluru SPC community
About me:
Grew up in a small town called Ajmer (in Rajasthan, India). Have lived in multiple cities across India, and in Boston for 3 years
Studied Chemical Engineering at IITBombay, and MBA from HBS
Scaled business 0-1 / 1-10 across a bunch of startups - Urban Company, Quizizz, Open Secret in business & product roles
What I’m working on:
Overall, passionate about solving consumer problems with technology & building for India. Specifically going deeper into the following spaces right now:
Early childhood / how to make a parents life easier - Dynamic stories using AI, something like tonies but more dynamic basis what the child points at / wants to talk more about; Vertical content platform for moms - by experts, which helps declutter all the instagram content
Skilling for elder care - skill & help talent find employment outside India (huge demand, with elderly population upwards of 25-30% in a lot of countries + would help with the unemployment problem in India)
Wellness:
As per a study, ~half of India’s population is classified as physically inactive / unfit and this will lead to a huge rise in chronic diseases soon. Not sure of a solution yet
Women’s wellness with PCOS, infertility etc on the rise. Out of a group of 10 couples I recently met, 5 were exploring IVF options -- seems like the problem is growing immensely in India
Personal Interests:
Love the outdoors - hiking, running
Travel - mostly mountains or forests, but beaches sometimes
Board games
Have been trying my hand at painting since the last couple of years, and its been extremely calming / meditative
We can talk about:
Consumer problem statements focused on India
Parenting - have been speaking to a lot of parents to understand common pain points
Skilling
Health & Wellness, Longevity (something I've started reading on recently)
Pictures: The first one is from Pushkar, close to where I grew up (also meet my 3 year old, Dhairya); the second one is from the Bessengen hike in Norway - one of the most scenic hikes I've been on (thats my husband in the pic, seems like I don't have any pics with myself in it on the hike but I promise I was there :face_with_hand_over_mouth:), one of my recent paintings (edited)

Shivam Mishra
  1:59 AM
Hi everyone! :wave:
I’m Shivam, thrilled to join the SPC family in Bangalore and connect with this amazing community!
About Me:
I grew up in Prayagraj—a holy hotspot in North India—and now I’m happily (sort of) settled in Bangalore, the Silicon Valley of India.
Proud father of a little partner-in-crime!
My career? Picture a whirlwind tour through HRTech, Fintech, and EdTech. I had a blast at Mobolt as a founding engineer (yep, we got acquired by Indeed), and
I’ve also navigated the corporate jungle at Indeed, Goldman Sachs, Walmart Labs, and Epic (the kids’ reading app, not the video game!).
Personal Interests:
Autobiographies and sci-fi are my go-tos, with Black Mirror fueling my passion for mind-bending concepts.
I’m guilty of binge-watching documentaries and love diving into human behavior in my spare time.
A beach lover at heart, I cherish moments with my family and enjoy a little stargazing—though my knowledge of stars is a work in progress!
I’m spiritual, have a keen interest in astrology, and
dabble in health-tech, neuroscience, and child development. Oh, and finance and investments are my jam
What I’m Currently Exploring:
At SurgeGrowth, I’m on a mission to make monetization a breeze for subscription apps and games alongside 
@Vaibhav
 and 
@Joe Kochitty
.
Let’s Chat About:
Programming in any language (I promise I’ll catch up fast),
System design ( Believer in efficient design more than language and tool)
Camping & stargazing (even if I don’t know much about stars), and
All things finance, and tech.
Fun Fact:
I love brainstorming "What If" scenarios—let’s get creative!

Hi SPC fam,
Excited to meet you all. I am Nina, co-founder and CEO of Loopin, a fashion B2B2C startup.
My professional experience has mostly been in large scaled consumer companies, including scribd, twitter and Linkedin. I spent ~7 months  in Mem.ai as well prior to starting my own  journey. I led full-stack engineering teams for 7 years.  Now I am developing Loopin from the ground up. It has never been better!
What is Loopin?
at the consumer side, Loopin wants to be the Mary Poppins' bag for fashion girls.
on the other hand, Loopin builds AI-powered tools for fashion professionals(e.g resellers) to source and sell inventory efficiently.
I am looking forward to learn from all of you. I m open to advice.  i would love to chat more about consumer or fashion industry. if i can be any help to you, please feel free to reach out.

:wave: Hi everyone, I’m Emily, a :boomerang: SPC member from Feb 2020!
Background: I’ve spent the past 10 years across various startups in San Francisco, from Growth PM’ing at Intercom to leading product at atSpoke (acquired by Okta). Most recently I founded Bento, a no-code platform for PMs to build customer onboarding & activation flows & experiments. Prior to SF I spent 10 years in Boston for college, b-school and management consulting.
Exploring: Climate! That’s a broad topic, so I’m currently focused on the energy transition and the built environment. Most recently I’ve gone down rabbit holes on grid congestion / transmission tech, low emissions cement, and the E&S insurance market. No winners yet.
Personal interests
Like every good Californian, I enjoy hiking! So much so that I spent my honeymoon hiking Patagonia and did a 4 day hut-to-hut trek in the Dolomites last summer.
The rest of my hobbies also make me a stereotype: wine (I used to be a competitive blind wine taster), food (and cooking!), dogs (especially my 3.5 year old mini sheepadoodle, Bonnie), and traveling :slightly_smiling_face:
The most original fun fact about me is that my travels have taken me to both North Korea and Iran, but I have yet to complete my “axis of evil” tour since I’m not actually into active conflict zones.
Ask me about: any of the above :point_up: and I’m always down to do an onboarding/activation workshop. It can run the gamut from diagnosing problems to the product principles behind great activation design to a tear-down of your UX!

I’m Kathy, another :boomerang: SPC member in SF, originally part of the October 2019 cohort!
Background: I’ve spent a dozen years bouncing around the data and analytics space, both as a founder and in various technical and non-technical roles in product, data, and strategy, across the private and public sector.
Previously at SPC, I co-founded Code for Democracy, a nonprofit that built tools to automate the analysis of open data for political journalists, researchers, and public interest groups. We raised some angel money and helped a few upstart newsrooms discover great stories. Ultimately, I felt like the space lost too much momentum post-2020 and there was no path to becoming big big. There were some memorable times though, like when I hid in my closet to do a NPR interview during COVID.
Most recently, I was a principal product manager at Amplitude, where I was the product lead for their new experimentation offering. I joined when the product was a recently-launched MVP, spent 2 years growing it to a point where we started thinking about ARR in 10s of millions, and left when Forrester claimed we were the category leader, ahead of Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, and Statsig. This was a really fun experience, but I like to say that building a 0-1 product in someone else’s company when you want your own is a bit like eating a sugarless cookie. The right shape, probably healthier for you overall, yet something about the texture is off.
I spent half a decade working at the intersection of data science and social impact. This included a stint in the Innovation Labs of the World Bank, where I led a team inventing new computational social science methods to better invest over $400M of public funds into entrepreneurial ecosystems across Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. I also worked with the ACLU to sue police departments for their racially disparate stop-and-frisk practices, primarily in Milwaukee but was also involved in similar cases in Chicago, Philadelphia, and the LA region.
My first job out of college was as a combination strategy consultant, data engineer, solutions architect, and customer success manager for APT, an enterprise software startup that was later acquired by Mastercard for $600M in one of the larger east coast exits at the time. These days, it’s probably better known for being the place the Klaviyo founders met.
I did my undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania, where I flirted with dropping out but decided to graduate in 3 years instead. Have avoided formal education since.
Exploring: I plan on staying in the data and analytics space. This time around, I’m looking to build something venture scale (and for profit). I love enterprise software and am interested in anything ranging from data infra to analytics tools for end users.
I’ve been hacking on a Chrome extension that makes it possible to click on charts in any saas tool and get the underlying data. Not sure where this will go yet. Maybe it's the start of something bigger, maybe not.
I’ve also explored some specific verticals like property management and patient advocates.
Personal:
I’m really into home gym equipment, so if you’re looking to design one, I’d love to help!
I also like trying out kitchen gadgets. Vacuum sealer? Obviously. Cotton candy maker? Yes, I have one too.
I’m somewhat reluctantly into planes and general aviation, as my husband loves flying and has dragged me into it over the years.
I have a 1-year-old who inspires me to learn more, faster. In the last 6 months, he’s begun to walk and talk. In the last 6 months, I’ve integrated coding copilots into my workflow. Definitely feels like he’s lapping me with his pace of learning. I’m also expecting a 2nd kid in January.
I was born in Shanghai, grew up in northeast Ohio, and lived in DC before moving to the Bay Area. I currently live in San Mateo.
Ask Me About: This is already a super long re-intro, so if any of the above feels like it would be relevant personally or professionally, I’m happy to dive in more! Generally, I can help you with product or data work. (edited)

Hi everyone, delighted to be part of this group. I am Neeraj Jain, based out of Bangalore, India. I have been an entrepreneur since 2006 when I started a business advisory firm. As a services firm, it made good cash flow but it wasn’t a scalable business.
My entrepreneurial success came through Zopper which started as the first hyperlocal marketplace in India in 2011. It raised $20mn+ from Tiger, Nirvana, Blume, etc. We sold a part of our business (long story there) to PhonePe in 2018 and I, along with my teammates, built India’s largest office merchants payment network.
After that, I tried my hands at education (Trying to build Masterclass for India) and it was a complete disaster. However, it was a great learning experience, and meeting and working with celebs for the first time in my life was a remarkable experience.
I took a break of 1.5 years after the education misadventure, and am working on a couple of thoughts currently.
I am most interested in spending time with my family. My wife and I are raising a teenager and toddler together and sincerely, it is tougher than building a startup :). In my free time, I like to cook, read fiction, travel, learn chess, and solve puzzles, especially the Japanese ones.
I have worked mostly in SMBs, E-commerce, and UPI payments space in India so you can ask me about these. (edited)

Hi Everyone,
I am Sudhakar. An engineer turned product leader with over 20 years of experience in leading technology-driven transformations at top e-commerce companies like Flipkart, Myntra, and Mensa Brands in India, I’ve had the opportunity to solve large-scale, complex consumer problems at the intersection of customer experience, supply chain management, and e-commerce platforms. During my time at these companies, I played a pivotal role in building systems that streamline purchasing decisions, optimize supply chains, and enhance customer experiences.
On personal side, I am married to a very beautiful person, have 2 lovely kids (a daughter and a son).
What you’re currently exploring
- At present, I am exploring the Agentic AI space to understanding the possibilities and limitations of the technology. If successful, there are a few domains on top of my mind which I feel can be disrupted with the technology.
- Would love to connect with the experts and explorers in this space. Looking forward!
Personal interests
- Like to keep myself engaged in some physical activity. Right now I am into running but before that I have tried various things like TT, gymming, swimming… I have done half marathon; can run 5km regularly with best timing of 5km in 19 mins (on treadmill).
- Rural economy of India - application of technology to improve the quality of life in the rural India
- Interested in e-commerce in general, given the time spent in the space.
What other members can ask you about
- I am good in e-commerce/commerce in-general, product management, payments (might be rustic now).

About me:
Prev CTO @ Complicore, a credentialing platform used by healthcare payers to manage vendor compliance, mostly in Non-Emergency Transportation.
Dropped out of NYU but spent a lot of time in the OSIRIS Lab with friends who now hack governments at Trail of Bits, got Apple to add a hardware flag for jailbreak detection at Uber Security, and founded Capsul8.
I have a family filled with artists and have accepted that instead of creating concept art for Dune 3 or selling hand made ceramic pottery, my medium is writing software to make the world more beautiful.
Born and raised in NYC, ask me about how selling fire crackers on Mott street almost started a war between the triads and the italian mob.
Currently exploring:
Making pretraining multimodal models more accessible
Healthcare reform, specifically e2e benefit management.
Personal interests:
Community, especially providing opportunities for the next generation.
Ball, watching basket and playing pickle.
Industrial design, I'm currently prototyping an under desk laptop mount so that I don't ever have to plug in a cable again.
Ask me about:
Healthcare payers and 18 month sales cycles
Distributed systems and why I think Cloudflare is killing it and not killing it at the same time
Multimodal models and the big friendly black box
also I'm getting married! Here's my fiancé and I in Paris:

Hi all, I'm Henry :slightly_smiling_face:
Background
Originally from Connecticut, studied Applied Math/CS @ Harvard. Based in NYC nowadays.
Joined Bubble as an early engineer back in 2020, wound up leading product on Platform + AI teams there
Quit my job in October—Bubble had grown from ~20->150 people and become a lot more mature; for me it's time to build something 0->1 again
Currently exploring: AI for Site Reliability Engineer persona
Leading product on Bubble's platform team, I saw a bunch of menial + repetitive work done by SREs.
We built a first version of an AI tool for regression detection at Bubble, engineers loved it
Personal interests:
Occasional musician (I'm on spotify!)
Catch me running on the west side highway most mornings
Ask me about:
Observability + site reliability, why most products in this space are approaching automation the wrong way
Building 0->1 AI products, usability testing + iterating quickly
No-code— why I think it's really great and you should consider using it to build an MVP
Enterprise security / SOC-2 —became a bit of an expert on this leading security at Bubble

Hi everyone, I’m Suyog - joining SPC in SF after living in New York for 9 years (UES for 7).
Background:
Ex-CTO and Cofounder of LastMileAI where we were working on bringing LLMs into production for businesses. I had to leave due to a medical issue, but am better now and exploring new opportunities in AI software development.
Prior to LastMIle, I was the tech lead of the Jupyter notebook platform (Bento) at Facebook and also worked at Oculus on WebGPU technology for a short while.
Before that I worked at Oscar Health - a health insurance startup in the NYC area; and was also at Capital One so have worked in heavily regulated industries before.
Graduated from Carnegie Mellon back in 2011 with a background in Electrical and Computer Engineering - Signals & Systems / Pattern recognition.
Currently Exploring:
Building an AI first software development platform. I’ve already built out an agent (pushrobin) that can take a GitHub issue and produce a working PR (PR review also updates the code), but saw that what I really wanted was “have a high level idea” and have it deployed into production automatically - which requires a rethinking of the entire software development stack. At Facebook, I’ve seen tooling much better than Github so am taking some inspiration from learnings working in Dev Infra there.
Personal interests:
Basketball and Football fan (Go Steelers!)
Into running & weight lifting - will probably find me running along Embarcadero now I’m in SF or east side of Central Park if I’m back in NYC
Huge JRPG video game fan - can probably talk to me about anything from SNES to modern ones
Ask me about:
Fullstack engineering, python, react, build systems
AI applications, embedding models, AI agents / agent “swarms”
Robotics (interested in, but haven’t really done work in the space since CMU)

About me:
I’ve spent over 17 years in big tech (Apple, Microsoft) building products at the intersection of machine learning and software engineering. I love diving deep into technical challenges and collaborating with teams to bring great products to life. At Apple, I led a team of ML scientists and engineers to create  Knowledge Answers feature for Siri, gaining hands-on experience with language models, retrieval systems, and building AI products at scale. Before that, I was an applied scientist at Microsoft, working on projects like Cortana, Bing, and Email Intelligence.
Three months ago, I decided to leave Apple to explore the startup world and see how I can contribute to building products that truly delight customers.
Currently Exploring:
Collaborating with three longtime friends (we go back over 20 years!) to brainstorm ideas for building a company focused on vertically integrated AI applications.
Currently exploring the legal domain, diving into legal workflows to see how generative AI could transform the practice of law.
Personal interests:
Spend time with kids (7 and <1), family and friends.
Love to travel and explore new cultures, food, music and nature. (Went to Oktoberfest in Munich this year - which was a blast!)
Biking and hiking to keep me physically active.
Enjoy reading science fiction, fantasy fiction, biographies.
Follow Formula 1. Go Ferrari!! Go Leclerc!!
Ask me about:
Shipping AI products / features at scale
LLMs, RAG, Natural language processing
Search systems, Information Retrieval
Voice assistants

Hi all, excited to be joining SPC in :foggy:
Background (LinkedIn, Twitter)
Grew up in Atlanta
Left high school and came to SF at 17, then decided I should try college. I managed to do 1 year of undergrad at Harvard
I didn’t intend to drop out to start a company, but still ended up doing that. I built Alloy over the past 5 years — we raised $27M from a16z, Bain, YC, etc; have major contracts w Amazon, Best Buy, etc. I led the company as CEO until a few months ago, then transitioned to Executive Chair because I wanted more time to explore the latest in AI. Especially as we’ve closed more enterprise deals, the types of things I want to build don’t fit neatly within Alloy.
I just returned to SF after 3 years in NYC. It feels amazing to be back here for -1 to 0 again, and approaching everything with a beginner’s mind.
Currently exploring:
LLM understanding of the DOM, AI QA, etc
Applying AI SEO to Alloy (have evaluated many tools in the space, not intending to build, but looking to buy)
Personal interests:
Old / foreign / arthouse films, architecture, business history (love Softwar, Kochland, etc)
I angel invest quite a bit, to learn vicariously through other founders
Looking for help with:
Founding eng referrals — looking for the types of folks who think about runtime / language design / architecture at large, quietly intense, strategic, craft-driven…
What I can help with / what other members can ask me about:
Marketing, design
Getting good at sales as a technical founder
Integrations
X (formerly Twitter)X (formerly Twitter)

Hi all, finally feeling like a human after a couple of days down!  I'm joining SPC in NYC with the latest batch, but I've spent equals amounts of time between SF and here.
About me (LinkedIn)
Born and raised in Chihuahua, Mexico (trivia fact: it means "dry and sandy place", no the dogs are not from there :dog2:).
I'm an Electronic Engineer, who fell in love with software and then got caught into the magic of building businesses and human centric experiences (I hold two patents).
Came to the East Coast for grad school, but ended up moving to SF to be amongst the first 200 employees at Dropbox. I stayed for 7 really fun years and worked across 3 different cities. 
I have built companies across B2B, Consumer, and Marketplaces in both horizontal and vertical use cases (logistics, fintech, retail). 
I've been Head of Product for a couple of Seed to Series C companies and built design, marketing, data, and product teams.
I'm infinitely curious and I'm always looking to learn new skills and ways of understanding the world.
Currently Exploring
How to bring personal styling to the masses and reduce waste in the fashion industry.  My first goal is to eliminate returns before they happen by improving the likelihood an item will fit and be the best style for an individual at the time of purchase.
I'm particularly interested in applying AI-agents to improve the customer interaction and apparel discovery, and a combination of 3D scanning and ML to better understand what fits a particular individual.
Personal Interests
Building stuff. Right now, carpentry is at the top of the list. I started dabbling into this during the pandemic. I built a kitchen, a fence, and a cat house. All of them are still standing, thank you YouTube! I want to get into Japanese Carpentry in 2025.
Reading science fiction. Isaac Asimov is a personal favorite.
Fashion, styling, design, and how they impact our mental, behavioral, and physical health.
Traveling and learning languages. I love how languages capture the values and worldviews of a culture.
Exploring new restaurants (especially in Queens!).
Ask me about
Infrastructure products, AI applications
Product Development, prototyping, customer discovery
Marketplaces and operations-heavy businesses
How to take your indoor cat for a hike
Here's a picture of me with my fiancé James and our cat Taki (yes, like the snacks!). Excited to be here :sparkles:
